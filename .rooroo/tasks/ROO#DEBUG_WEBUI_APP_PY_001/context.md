Parent Task ID: ROO#SUB_A1B2C3_S003_20250523234133_C003
Goal: Debug and fix the AttributeError in web_ui/app.py.

Error Details:
AttributeError: 'HTMLElement' object has no attribute 'div'
File: web_ui/app.py
Line: 200 (approximately, based on traceback)

Context:
The error occurred after implementing backend logic for Project Management. The `home` route in `web_ui/app.py` is attempting to render an htpy component, but it seems there's an issue with how `h.div` (or a similar htpy element constructor) is being called.

Relevant files:
- web_ui/app.py
- Potentially htpy documentation or examples if the usage is incorrect.

Acceptance Criteria:
- The AttributeError in web_ui/app.py is resolved.
- The home page of the web application loads without error.
- The fix is verified by running the web application.
