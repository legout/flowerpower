# FlowerPower Codebase Analysis for Web Application Development

## Objective
Analyze the existing FlowerPower codebase to understand the current architecture, core components, and data models that will inform the web application design.

## Key Analysis Areas

### 1. Core Architecture Components
- **Pipeline Management**: Examine [src/flowerpower/pipeline/](src/flowerpower/pipeline/) for pipeline structure, execution models
- **Job Queue Systems**: Analyze [src/flowerpower/job_queue/](src/flowerpower/job_queue/) for queue management patterns
- **Configuration Systems**: Review [src/flowerpower/cfg/](src/flowerpower/cfg/) for project and pipeline configuration schemas
- **Plugin Architecture**: Investigate [src/flowerpower/plugins/](src/flowerpower/plugins/) for extensibility patterns

### 2. Data Models & APIs
- Extract key data structures from pipeline, job queue, and configuration modules
- Identify existing CLI interfaces in [src/flowerpower/cli/](src/flowerpower/cli/) that could inform web API design
- Document configuration file formats from [examples/](examples/) directories

### 3. Multi-Project Support Requirements
- Examine how projects are currently defined and structured
- Analyze project configuration patterns from example projects
- Identify requirements for project management, switching, and organization

### 4. Integration Points
- Document existing integrations (Hamilton, MQTT, databases)
- Identify extensibility points for web application integration
- Assess current logging, monitoring, and observability features

## Expected Deliverables
1. Architecture overview document
2. Data model specifications
3. API interface recommendations
4. Multi-project management requirements
5. Integration strategy recommendations

## Files to Focus On
- [src/flowerpower/flowerpower.py](src/flowerpower/flowerpower.py) - Main entry point
- [src/flowerpower/pipeline/manager.py](src/flowerpower/pipeline/manager.py) - Pipeline management
- [src/flowerpower/job_queue/base.py](src/flowerpower/job_queue/base.py) - Job queue abstractions
- [src/flowerpower/cfg/project/](src/flowerpower/cfg/project/) - Project configuration
- [examples/](examples/) - Real-world usage patterns
