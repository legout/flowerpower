### Extensibility Points
-   **I/O Plugins**: The system in [`src/flowerpower/plugins/io/`](src/flowerpower/plugins/io/) is designed for adding new data loaders and savers.
-   **Adapters**: The adapter configuration ([`src/flowerpower/cfg/project/adapter.py`](src/flowerpower/cfg/project/adapter.py:1), [`src/flowerpower/cfg/pipeline/adapter.py`](src/flowerpower/cfg/pipeline/adapter.py:1)) allows integrating various tools for tracking, execution, and monitoring. New adapters could be developed.
-   **Job Queue Backends**: While APScheduler and RQ are implemented, the `BaseJobQueueManager` suggests that other job queue systems could be added.
-   **Pipeline Hooks**: `PipelineRegistry.add_hook()` allows injecting custom logic at various points in the pipeline lifecycle.

### Logging, Monitoring, and Observability
-   **Logging**: `loguru` is used for logging throughout the codebase (e.g., in `PipelineManager`). Log levels can often be configured per pipeline run.
-   **Monitoring & Tracing**:
    -   **OpenTelemetry**: Integration suggests capabilities for distributed tracing and metrics collection.
    -   **Hamilton Tracker**: Provides insights into Hamilton DAG execution, data lineage, and statistics.
    -   **MLflow**: Used for tracking experiments, runs, parameters, and metrics.
-   **Job Queue Monitoring**: Specific job queue systems (RQ, APScheduler) often come with their own monitoring tools or dashboards (e.g., RQ Dashboard). The web application could potentially integrate or link to these.
