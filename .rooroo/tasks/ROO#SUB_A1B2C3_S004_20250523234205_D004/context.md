Parent Task ID: ROO#TASK_20250523213800_A1B2C3
Previous Sub-Task ID: [ROO#SUB_A1B2C3_S003_20250523234133_C003](/.rooroo/tasks/ROO#SUB_A1B2C3_S003_20250523234133_C003/context.md) (Project Management Backend)

Goal for Expert (rooroo-developer):
Implement basic Pipeline Management UI and backend logic.
1.  Design and implement UI (htpy + Datastar) for:
    *   Listing pipelines associated with a selected project.
    *   A form to add a new pipeline (name, description, basic configuration options - keep simple for now).
    *   Displaying pipeline status and metadata (mock data or basic status initially).
2.  Develop Sanic endpoints for:
    *   Adding a new pipeline to a project.
    *   Listing pipelines for a given project.
    *   (Optional) Editing basic pipeline metadata.
3.  Connect the frontend UI to these backend endpoints for reactive updates.
4.  The FlowerPower library itself ([`src/flowerpower`](/src/flowerpower:1)) should be used for any underlying pipeline definition or management if applicable at this stage, though direct integration with its execution/scheduling features will be in later tasks. Focus on the UI and basic CRUD for pipeline entities.

Deliverables:
- Updated Sanic application source code with basic pipeline listing and creation features.
- Documentation for new API endpoints related to pipeline management.
