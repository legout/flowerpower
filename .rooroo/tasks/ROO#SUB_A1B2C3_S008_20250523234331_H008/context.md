Parent Task ID: ROO#TASK_20250523213800_A1B2C3
Previous Sub-Task ID: [ROO#SUB_A1B2C3_S007_20250523234316_G007](/.rooroo/tasks/ROO#SUB_A1B2C3_S007_20250523234316_G007/context.md) (Job Queue Operations)

Goal for Expert (rooroo-documenter):
Create comprehensive documentation for the FlowerPower web application.
1.  User Guide:
    *   How to install and run the web application.
    *   Detailed explanations of each feature: Project Management, Pipeline Management (including execution, queuing, scheduling, visualization), and Job Queue Operations.
    *   Screenshots and step-by-step instructions.
2.  Developer Guide:
    *   Application architecture overview (Sanic, htpy, Datastar integration).
    *   Key modules and their responsibilities.
    *   API endpoint documentation (generated or manually written).
    *   Instructions for setting up a development environment.
    *   Guidelines for extending the application with new features.
3.  Inline Code Comments: Review and enhance inline comments for clarity and completeness across the new web application codebase.

Key information from parent context:
- The entire scope of the application developed in previous sub-tasks.
- Technical Requirements (Lines [32-37](/.rooroo/tasks/ROO#TASK_20250523213800_A1B2C3/context.md:32)): Sanic, htpy, Datastar, incremental development, responsive design, error handling.

Dependencies:
- Completed web application from [ROO#SUB_A1B2C3_S007_20250523234316_G007](/.rooroo/tasks/ROO#SUB_A1B2C3_S007_20250523234316_G007/context.md) and all preceding development tasks.
- Analysis report from [ROO#SUB_A1B2C3_S001_20250523233918_A001](/.rooroo/tasks/ROO#SUB_A1B2C3_S001_20250523233918_A001/context.md) for architectural insights.

Deliverables:
- User guide document (e.g., Markdown or HTML).
- Developer guide document.
- Updated source code with improved inline comments.
- All documentation should be placed in a `docs/web_ui/` subdirectory within the main project or the `web_ui/docs/` subdirectory.
