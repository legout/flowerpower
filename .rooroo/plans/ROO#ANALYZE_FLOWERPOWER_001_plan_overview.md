# Plan Overview for Task: ROO#ANALYZE_FLOWERPOWER_001

**Parent Goal:** Plan a comprehensive technical analysis of the 'Flowerpower' Python workflow framework and prepare a structured technical documentation.

This plan outlines the sub-tasks required to achieve the parent goal.

## Sub-tasks:

1.  **Task ID:** `ROO#SUB_001_S001`
    *   **Expert:** `rooroo-analyzer`
    *   **Goal:** Analyze the 'Flowerpower' Python framework codebase to understand its architecture, core components (e.g., pipeline management, job queues, I/O plugins, configuration), data flow patterns, internal/external dependencies, error handling mechanisms, and adherence to Python best practices. Identify key modules and their interactions.
    *   **Context:** [./.rooroo/tasks/ROO#SUB_001_S001/context.md](./.rooroo/tasks/ROO#SUB_001_S001/context.md)
    *   **Expected Output:** A detailed analysis report in Markdown format.

2.  **Task ID:** `ROO#SUB_001_S002`
    *   **Expert:** `rooroo-analyzer`
    *   **Goal:** Based on the initial technical analysis (output of sub-task ROO#SUB_001_S001), critically evaluate the 'Flowerpower' framework. Identify its strengths, weaknesses, and specific areas for improvement concerning performance, scalability, and maintainability.
    *   **Context:** [./.rooroo/tasks/ROO#SUB_001_S002/context.md](./.rooroo/tasks/ROO#SUB_001_S002/context.md)
    *   **Depends on:** ROO#SUB_001_S001
    *   **Expected Output:** A Markdown document detailing strengths, weaknesses, and areas for improvement.

3.  **Task ID:** `ROO#SUB_001_S003`
    *   **Expert:** `rooroo-documenter`
    *   **Goal:** Compile the findings from the technical analysis (ROO#SUB_001_S001) and critical evaluation (ROO#SUB_001_S002) into a comprehensive, structured technical documentation for the 'Flowerpower' framework.
    *   **Context:** [./.rooroo/tasks/ROO#SUB_001_S003/context.md](./.rooroo/tasks/ROO#SUB_001_S003/context.md)
    *   **Depends on:** ROO#SUB_001_S001, ROO#SUB_001_S002
    *   **Expected Output:** A structured technical documentation in Markdown format.
