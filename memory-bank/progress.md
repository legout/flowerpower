# Progress Log

*   [2025-04-10 14:14:58] - **Task Started:** Initialize Memory Bank.
*   [2025-04-10 14:14:58] - **Status:** Defined initial content for Memory Bank files (`productContext.md`, `activeContext.md`, `systemPatterns.md`, `decisionLog.md`, `progress.md`). Files created successfully.

*   [2025-04-10 21:14:00] - **Task Started:** Implement a unified interface for RQ, Huey, and APScheduler.
*   [2025-04-10 21:15:00] - **Status:** Designed the unified interface, created the core files and configuration classes. Encountered issues with RQ and Huey adapters. APScheduler adapter not implemented due to missing library.
*   [2025-04-11 12:17:24] - **Task Completed:** Created worker interface examples (apscheduler_example.py, rq_example.py, huey_example.py) in examples/ directory.
*   [2025-04-12 15:30:47] - **Task Completed:** Refactored `BaseBackendType` Enum in `src/flowerpower/worker/base.py` to use a data-driven approach for backend properties, improving readability and maintainability.
*   [2025-04-12 15:59:31] - **Task Completed:** Improved and optimized code in `src/flowerpower/worker/apscheduler/trigger.py` using best practices (Enum, Factory pattern), enhancing readability, maintainability, and error handling.
*   [2025-04-13 18:43:22] - **Task Completed:** Refactored configuration classes in `src/flowerpower/cfg/` and subdirectories from pydantic (`Field`, `model_post_init`) to msgspec (`field`, `__post_init__`).
*   [2025-04-14 16:37:45] - **Status:** Implemented Huey trigger classes (`HueyCronTrigger`, `HueyIntervalTrigger`, `HueyDateTrigger`) in `src/flowerpower/worker/huey/trigger.py` and updated `src/flowerpower/worker/huey/__init__.py` to export them. This maps FlowerPower's abstract triggers to Huey's scheduling mechanisms.
