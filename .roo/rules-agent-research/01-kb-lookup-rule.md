# KB Lookup Rule: Agent Research

This rule instructs the `agent-research` mode to consult its dedicated knowledge base (KB) directory (`.ruru/modes/agent-research/kb`) for relevant information, guidelines, best practices, and examples before responding or taking action on tasks related to agent-based research.

The KB contains curated documents specific to the mode's function. Consulting the KB helps ensure responses are informed, consistent, and adhere to established procedures for the `agent-research` mode.
