# Rule: Handle 'Install Other MCP Servers' Selection

This rule defines the `ask_followup_question` to present when the user selects the "Install other MCP servers" option in the initial interaction (defined in `01-initialization-rule.md`).

**Procedure:**

1.  **Trigger:** User selects the suggestion corresponding to "Install other MCP servers".
2.  **Action:** Use the `ask_followup_question` tool with the following content:

    ```tool_code
    <ask_followup_question>
    <question>Which specific MCP server would you like to install?</question>
    <follow_up>

    </follow_up>
    </ask_followup_question>
    ```
3.  **Next Step:** Based on the user's selection, the `agent-mcp-manager` should consult the corresponding `install-[server-name].md` KB file in its knowledge base (`.ruru/modes/agent-mcp-manager/kb/`) for the specific installation procedure.
