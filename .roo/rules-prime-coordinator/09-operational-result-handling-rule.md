# Rule: Operational Delegate Result Handling (Simplified)

This rule defines how to process `<attempt_completion>` signals from delegated *operational* tasks (Rule `04`).

**Procedure:**

1.  **Await Signal:** Wait for `<attempt_completion>` from the specialist.
2.  **Process Signal:** Extract result, identify task, assess outcome (‚úÖ success, ‚ùå failure, üß± blocker).
3.  **Log Outcome:** Log the reported outcome (Rule `07`).
4.  **Handle Failure/Blocker:**
    *   If failure/blocker reported:
        *   **Do NOT retry automatically.**
        *   Analyze the error message. Is the cause simple/obvious?
        *   **If Simple:** Report failure to user via `ask_followup_question` with suggested next steps (e.g., retry, cancel, stage files). Await user direction.
        *   **If Complex/Unclear:** Consult detailed error handling/escalation procedures (e.g., KB `.ruru/modes/roo-commander/kb/05-collaboration-escalation.md`) or escalate analysis.
5.  **Handle Success:**
    *   If success reported:
        *   Review success message/artifacts.
        *   Determine the next logical step.
        *   Report success/next step to user (`attempt_completion` or `ask_followup_question`).
