# Fix Summary: Pipeline Configuration and Parameterize Issues

## Issues Fixed

### 1. **PipelineConfig.from_yaml() Method Signature Issue**
- **Problem**: The `PipelineConfig.from_yaml()` method was being called with an unsupported `storage_options` parameter.
- **Fix**: Updated `config_manager.py` to pass only the supported parameters (`name`, `path`, `fs`).

### 2. **File Extension Mismatch (.yml vs .yaml)**
- **Problem**: The code was looking for `.yaml` files but the configuration files use `.yml` extension.
- **Fix**:
  - Updated `config_manager.py` to support both `.yml` and `.yaml` extensions
  - Updated `PipelineConfig.load()` method to try both extensions
  - Added a fallback mechanism to check multiple file paths

### 3. **Double Slash Path Issue**
- **Problem**: Path construction was creating double slashes (e.g., `base//conf/`).
- **Fix**: Used `os.path.join()` instead of string concatenation to ensure proper path separators.

### 4. **Hamilton @parameterize Decorator Issue**
- **Problem**: The pipeline was using `**PARAMS.avg_x_wk_spend` which unpacked the dictionary incorrectly.
- **Fix**: Changed to use `avg_x_wk_spend=PARAMS.avg_x_wk_spend` to pass the parameter dictionary correctly.

### 5. **Parameter Loading Issue**
- **Problem**: The `PipelineConfig.from_dict()` method wasn't calling `__post_init__()`, which caused `h_params` to not be properly initialized.
- **Fix**: Added a manual call to `__post_init__()` in the `from_dict()` method.

## Key Changes Made

### In `src/flowerpower/pipeline/config_manager.py`:
1. Fixed import path for `get_filesystem`
2. Updated `load_pipeline_config()` to:
   - Support both `.yml` and `.yaml` extensions
   - Use proper path construction with `os.path.join()`
   - Fix method signature for `PipelineConfig.from_yaml()`

### In `src/flowerpower/cfg/pipeline/__init__.py`:
1. Added manual `__post_init__()` call in `from_dict()` method
2. Updated `load()` method to try both file extensions

### In `examples/hello-world/base/pipelines/hello_world.py`:
1. Fixed `@parameterize` decorator usage
2. Added a workaround for config loading (temporary)

## Test Results

The hello-world pipeline now runs successfully:
- Imports without errors
- Loads configuration correctly
- Parameterize decorators work as expected
- Execution produces correct results

## Next Steps

1. The core issues have been fixed, but the pipeline still uses a workaround for config loading
2. The proper fix would be to update the installed package with the changes to `PipelineConfig.load()`
3. Consider adding better error messages for file not found scenarios
4. Add tests to ensure the fixes work correctly
