# Knowledge Base: Context Condenser Mode

This directory contains the knowledge base (KB) files that define the operational principles, procedures, and collaboration protocols for the `agent-context-condenser` mode. These instructions guide the mode in generating dense, structured summaries (Condensed Context Indices) from technical documentation.

## KB Files

*   **`01-principles.md` (11 lines):** Outlines the core principles for creating AI-centric, dense, structured, prioritized, and actionable context indices.
*   **`02-sop-condensing.md` (83 lines):** Details the step-by-step Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for generating Condensed Context Indices from various sources.
*   **`03-collaboration.md` (13 lines):** Defines how the mode interacts with other modes for task invocation, reporting outcomes, and escalating specific issues.
*   **`04-error-handling.md` (5 lines):** Provides specific guidance on logging and reporting significant errors encountered during the condensation process.
