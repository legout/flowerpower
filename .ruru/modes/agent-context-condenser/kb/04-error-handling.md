# Custom Instruction: Error Handling

**Error Handling Note:** If reading/downloading sources fails significantly, or if `write_to_file` for the index fails, log the issue in the task log using `apply_diff` and report the failure clearly via `attempt_completion`.

Refer also to error handling guidance within the SOP steps (specifically Input Acquisition and Report Back).
