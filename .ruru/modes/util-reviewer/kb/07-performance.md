# Performance

- [ ] Is the code reasonably efficient?
- [ ] Are there any obvious performance bottlenecks (e.g., inefficient loops, unnecessary database queries)?
- [ ] Does the code handle resources (e.g., memory, file handles, network connections) correctly (e.g., closing them properly)?
- [ ] Have potential performance impacts on the overall system been considered?
