# KB Procedure: Remove MCP Server

## 1. Objective üéØ
Safely remove an installed MCP server by deleting its directory and removing its configuration entry from `.roo/mcp.json` after user confirmation.

## 2. Preconditionsüö¶
*   `.roo/mcp.json` exists.

## 3. Procedure Steps ü™ú

1.  **Read Configuration & List Servers:**
    *   Use `read_file` to load `.roo/mcp.json`.
    *   Parse the JSON. Handle potential errors (e.g., file not found, invalid JSON). If errors occur, report failure and stop.
    *   Extract the names (keys) of the servers listed under the `mcpServers` object.
    *   If no servers are found (i.e., `mcpServers` object is empty or missing), report "No MCP servers are currently configured for removal." using `<attempt_completion>` and stop.

2.  **Prompt User for Selection:**
    *   Use `ask_followup_question`:
        *   `question`: "Which MCP server would you like to remove?"
        *   `follow_up`: Create a `<suggest>` tag for each server name found in step 1. Add a final `<suggest>Cancel Removal</suggest>`.
    *   Store the user's selected server name (e.g., `server_to_remove`). If the user cancels, inform them "Removal cancelled." and stop the procedure.

3.  **Confirm Removal:**
    *   Use `ask_followup_question`:
        *   `question`: "Are you sure you want to permanently remove the '{{server_to_remove}}' MCP server? This will delete its files in `.ruru/mcp-servers/` and its entry in `.roo/mcp.json`."
        *   `follow_up`:
            *   `<suggest>Yes, remove {{server_to_remove}}</suggest>`
            *   `<suggest>No, cancel removal</suggest>`
    *   If the user selects "No", inform them "Removal cancelled." and stop the procedure.

4.  **Delete Server Directory:**
    *   Define `target_dir`: `.ruru/mcp-servers/{{server_to_remove}}`
    *   Inform the user: "Attempting to delete server directory: {{target_dir}}..."
    *   Use `execute_command`: `rm -rf {{target_dir}}`
    *   Check the exit code. Log any errors (e.g., "Warning: Failed to delete directory {{target_dir}}. It might not exist or there could be a permissions issue.") but proceed to the next step regardless.

5.  **Update MCP Configuration (`.roo/mcp.json`):**
    *   Inform the user: "Removing '{{server_to_remove}}' from `.roo/mcp.json`..."
    *   Use the parsed JSON data from Step 1 (or re-read if necessary).
    *   Check if the key `{{server_to_remove}}` exists in the `mcpServers` object.
    *   If it exists, delete the key `{{server_to_remove}}` from the `mcpServers` object.
    *   If it doesn't exist, note this ("Server entry already absent from configuration.") but continue.
    *   Use `write_to_file` to save the modified JSON object back to `.roo/mcp.json`. Ensure proper formatting (e.g., using `JSON.stringify(data, null, 2)`).
    *   Verify success. If `write_to_file` fails, report the error and stop.

6.  **Report Completion:**
    *   Use `attempt_completion`: "Successfully removed the '{{server_to_remove}}' MCP server configuration. Directory removal status logged. You may need to reload extensions and/or VS Code if the server was running."

## 4. Rationale / Notes ü§î
*   Includes user selection and confirmation steps for safety.
*   Attempts to remove both files and configuration, logging directory deletion errors but continuing to ensure config cleanup.
*   Does not currently handle stopping the server process before removal - this is a potential enhancement for the core MCP system.
*   Uses `rm -rf`, which is powerful; requires careful implementation by the agent to ensure the `target_dir` variable is correctly substituted.
