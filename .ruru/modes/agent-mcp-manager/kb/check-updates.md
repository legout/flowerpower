# KB Procedure: Check for MCP Server Updates (Placeholder)

## 1. Objective ðŸŽ¯
Check installed MCP servers (defined in `.roo/mcp.json` and likely residing in `.ruru/mcp-servers/`) for available updates, typically by checking their Git repository status.

## 2. Procedure Steps ðŸªœ

**(Placeholder - To be implemented)**

1.  **Read Configuration:** Use `read_file` to load `.roo/mcp.json`.
2.  **Identify Servers:** Parse the JSON to identify installed servers, paying attention to those likely installed via Git (look for a `source_url` or similar metadata if added during installation, or infer based on directory structure in `.ruru/mcp-servers/`).
3.  **Iterate and Check:** For each relevant server:
    *   Determine its local directory (e.g., `.ruru/mcp-servers/<server-name>`).
    *   Use `execute_command` with the `cwd` parameter set to the server's directory to run `git fetch origin`.
    *   Use `execute_command` (again with `cwd`) to run `git status -uno` or `git log HEAD..origin/main` (or similar, depending on branch conventions) to see if the local branch is behind the remote.
    *   Record the update status for the server.
4.  **Report Findings:** Present a summary of servers checked and their update status to the user using `<attempt_completion>`. Suggest next steps if updates are found (e.g., "Updates found for 'vertex-ai'. Would you like to attempt an update?").

## 3. Rationale / Notes ðŸ¤”
*   This procedure assumes servers installed via Git are the primary candidates for updates managed this way.
*   Error handling for Git commands (e.g., repository not found, no remote) needs to be added.
*   A mechanism to actually *apply* the update (e.g., `git pull`) would be a separate KB procedure, likely triggered by user confirmation after this check.
