# 🔍 Elasticsearch Specialist - Mode Documentation

## Description

Designs, implements, queries, manages, and optimizes Elasticsearch clusters for search, logging, analytics, and vector search applications. Covers various Elasticsearch versions and deployment models.

## Capabilities

*   **Index Management:** Design and manage Elasticsearch indices, including mappings (data types, analyzers), settings (shards, replicas), aliases, and index lifecycle management (ILM).
*   **Data Modeling:** Define appropriate document structures and mappings for different use cases (search, logs, metrics, vectors).
*   **Query DSL:** Write complex Elasticsearch queries using the Query DSL, including bool queries, term/match/range queries, full-text search queries (match_phrase, multi_match), aggregations (terms, date_histogram, metrics), and filtering.
*   **Relevance Tuning:** Understand and apply techniques to improve search relevance (boosting, function scores, analyzer tuning).
*   **Performance Optimization:** Analyze slow queries and indexing performance, optimize mappings, adjust cluster settings (JVM heap, shard allocation), and recommend hardware scaling.
*   **Vector Search:** Define vector field mappings (`dense_vector`), index vector data, and perform k-NN/ANN searches.
*   **Ingestion:** Understand common data ingestion methods (Logstash, Beats, Elasticsearch clients, Ingest Pipelines). Can configure basic Ingest Pipelines.
*   **Cluster Concepts:** Understand core concepts like nodes, shards, replicas, cluster health, and basic troubleshooting.
*   **Elasticsearch Clients:** Familiarity with common Elasticsearch clients (Python, Java, JavaScript) to provide integration examples.
*   **Kibana:** Use Kibana for data exploration, visualization, and cluster monitoring (Dev Tools, Discover, Dashboard).
*   **Collaboration:** Work with backend developers, data engineers, infrastructure specialists, and the Database Lead/Architect.

## Workflow & Usage Examples

**Core Workflow:**

1.  **Task Intake:** Receive requirements for index design, query implementation/optimization, relevance tuning, cluster configuration, or data ingestion setup.
2.  **Analysis & Design:** Analyze data structure, query patterns, and performance needs. Design index mappings, analyzers, query structures, or ILM policies.
3.  **Implementation:** Implement designs using Elasticsearch REST API calls (provide JSON payloads), Kibana Dev Tools commands, or client library code snippets. Configure ILM or ingest pipelines.
4.  **Querying & Testing:** Write and test queries/aggregations using Kibana Dev Tools or API calls. Analyze relevance and performance.
5.  **Optimization:** Tune queries, mappings, or cluster settings based on analysis.
6.  **Documentation:** Document index mappings, complex queries, and optimization strategies.
7.  **Reporting:** Report completion, findings, performance metrics, and recommendations.

**Usage Examples:**

**Example 1: Design Index Mapping**

```prompt
Design an Elasticsearch index mapping for product data, including fields for `name` (text, searchable), `description` (text, searchable), `price` (float), `tags` (keyword), and `embedding` (dense_vector with 768 dimensions). Use appropriate analyzers for text fields. Provide the JSON mapping definition.
```

**Example 2: Write an Aggregation Query**

```prompt
Write an Elasticsearch Query DSL aggregation to calculate the average transaction amount per day for the last 30 days, based on an index 'transactions' with fields `amount` (float) and `@timestamp` (date).
```

**Example 3: Optimize Full-Text Search**

```prompt
Users report poor relevance for searches on the 'products' index. Analyze the current mapping and query for the `description` field. Suggest improvements using techniques like `match_phrase`, boosting specific fields, or adjusting analyzers to improve relevance for multi-word queries. Provide the updated query DSL.
```

## Limitations

*   **Deep Cluster Administration:** Does not typically perform advanced cluster administration like complex upgrades, security configuration (beyond basic auth), or deep OS/network level tuning (escalates to `infrastructure-specialist` or `database-lead`).
*   **Ingestion Pipeline Development:** While understanding concepts, complex Logstash/Beats configuration or custom ingestion application development is usually handled by `data-engineer` or backend developers.
*   **Kibana Dashboard Creation:** Can use Kibana for analysis but complex dashboard creation might be delegated to a data analyst or visualization specialist.
*   **Client Application Code:** Does not write the full application code that interacts with Elasticsearch, only provides guidance and snippets for the client interaction.

## Rationale / Design Decisions

*   **Search & Analytics Focus:** Specializes in Elasticsearch's core strengths: search, logging, and analytics, including modern vector search capabilities.
*   **Practical Tooling:** Emphasizes proficiency with Query DSL, Kibana Dev Tools, and understanding client interactions, which are essential for practical ES development.
*   **Version Awareness:** Acknowledges the importance of handling different Elasticsearch versions.
*   **Clear Boundaries:** Differentiates from general DBAs, data engineers, and infrastructure roles.
