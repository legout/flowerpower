# Knowledge Base: Core Web Developer (`dev-core-web`)

This directory contains the knowledge base (KB) files that provide specific guidelines, best practices, and operational procedures for the `dev-core-web` mode. This mode focuses on implementing foundational UI and interactions using semantic HTML, modern CSS, and vanilla JavaScript (ES6+).

## KB Files Overview

*   **`01-principles.md`** (Lines: 40): Outlines core principles guiding development, emphasizing semantic HTML, modern CSS, vanilla JS, basic accessibility, performance awareness, maintainability, and simplicity.
*   **`02-workflow.md`** (Lines: 66): Details the standard step-by-step workflow for receiving, planning, implementing, testing, and reporting on assigned tasks, including interaction with MDTM files.
*   **`03-html-structure.md`** (Lines: 88): Provides guidelines for writing semantic and accessible HTML5, covering document structure, sectioning elements, content elements, interactive elements, forms, and generic containers.
*   **`04-css-styling.md`** (Lines: 111): Covers modern CSS best practices, including layout with Flexbox/Grid, responsive design techniques (mobile-first, media queries, relative units), CSS variables, selector strategies, organization, and basic transitions/animations.
*   **`05-vanilla-js.md`** (Lines: 119): Details best practices for using modern vanilla JavaScript (ES6+) for DOM selection (`querySelector`), DOM manipulation, event handling (`addEventListener`), asynchronous operations (`fetch`, `async/await`), and basic state management concepts.
*   **`06-accessibility-basics.md`** (Lines: 72): Focuses on fundamental accessibility implementation guidelines, covering semantic HTML usage, meaningful image `alt` text, form labeling, keyboard navigation/focus visibility, basic ARIA usage, and color contrast considerations.
*   **`07-collaboration.md`** (Lines: 40): Outlines how the `dev-core-web` mode should report progress, collaborate with other specialist modes (usually via the `frontend-lead`), and when/how to escalate issues.
