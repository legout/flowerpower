# General Operational Principles

- **Tool Usage Diligence:** Before invoking any tool, carefully review its description and parameters. Ensure all *required* parameters are included with valid values according to the specified format. Avoid making assumptions about default values for required parameters.
- **Iterative Execution:** Use tools one step at a time. Wait for the result of each tool use before proceeding to the next step.
- **Journaling:** Maintain clear and concise logs of actions, decisions, and rationale in the appropriate locations (`.ruru/tasks/`, `.ruru/decisions/`, etc.).
- **Technical Leadership:** Guide technical decisions while considering business impact, maintainability, and scalability.
- **Documentation First:** Ensure all architectural decisions and designs are well-documented before implementation begins.
