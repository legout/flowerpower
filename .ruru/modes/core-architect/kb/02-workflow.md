# Workflow / Operational Steps

**Architectural Workflow:**

1.  **Receive Task & Initialize Log:** Get assignment (e.g., "Design architecture for Feature Y", with Task ID `[TaskID]`) and context (references to requirements, Stack Profile from Discovery Agent) from Roo Commander or Project Manager. **Guidance:** Log the initial goal to the task log file (`.ruru/tasks/[TaskID].md`) using `insert_content` or `write_to_file`.
    - *Initial Log Content Example:*
        ```markdown
        # Task Log: [TaskID] - Architecture Design: [Feature Y]

        **Goal:** Design architecture for [Feature Y], considering [Key Constraints/Goals].
        **Context:** Requirements (`.ruru/docs/requirements.md`), Stack Profile (`.ruru/context/stack_profile.md`)
        ```
2.  **Understand Requirements & Context:** Use `read_file` to thoroughly analyze project goals, user stories, constraints (`.ruru/docs/requirements.md`), and the technical landscape (`.ruru/context/stack_profile.md`). Collaborate with `Discovery Agent` if context is insufficient. **Guidance:** Log key insights, assumptions, and questions in task log (`.ruru/tasks/[TaskID].md`) using `insert_content`.
3.  **High-Level Design & Modeling:** Define the high-level structure, key components (services, modules, layers), data flow, and major interactions. Consider using conceptual models (e.g., C4, UML via Mermaid). Perform structured **trade-off analysis** (e.g., decision matrices) for critical choices. **Guidance:** Document design progress, alternatives considered, and rationale in task log (`.ruru/tasks/[TaskID].md`) using `insert_content`.
4.  **Technology Selection:** Based on requirements, NFRs, Stack Profile, and trade-off analysis, select appropriate technology stacks, frameworks, databases, cloud services, etc. Use `browser` for research if needed, or **escalate** specific research needs to `Research & Context Builder`. Provide clear justification for choices. **Guidance:** Document selections and rationale in task log and potentially ADRs.
5.  **Define & Address NFRs:** Explicitly define and design for non-functional requirements (scalability, performance, security, availability, maintainability, cost). Collaborate with specialists like `Security Specialist` and `Performance Optimizer`. **Guidance:** Document NFRs and how the architecture addresses them in the main architecture document and task log.
6.  **Document Key Decisions (ADRs):** For significant architectural decisions (technology choices, patterns, major trade-offs), create an Architecture Decision Record (ADR). **Guidance:** Use `write_to_file` targeting `.ruru/decisions/YYYYMMDD-topic.md` using the ADR format. Log the decision summary and reference in the task log (`.ruru/tasks/[TaskID].md`) using `insert_content`.
    - *ADR Content Example:*
        ```markdown
        # ADR: [Decision Topic]

        **Status:** [Proposed | Accepted | Rejected | Deprecated | Superseded]
        **Context:** [Problem statement, constraints, forces]
        **Decision:** [Chosen option]
        **Rationale:** [Justification, trade-offs considered, evidence]
        **Consequences:** [Positive and negative impacts, future considerations]
        ```
7.  **Create/Update Formal Architecture Document:** Consolidate the design, decisions, NFRs, and technology choices into the core architecture document (`.ruru/docs/architecture.md`). Ensure it reflects the current state and provides a clear blueprint. **Guidance:** Prepare the full content and save/update using `write_to_file` targeting `.ruru/docs/architecture.md`.
8.  **Request/Create Diagrams:** Visualize the architecture. **Guidance:** Delegate diagram creation/updates (e.g., C4, sequence, deployment using Mermaid) to the `diagramer` mode via `new_task`, providing clear conceptual instructions. Alternatively, create/update simple diagrams directly in Markdown using `write_to_file`. Ensure diagrams are stored in `.ruru/docs/diagrams/`.
9.  **Define Technical Standards & Guidelines:** Establish or update coding standards, best practices, and technical guidelines relevant to the architecture. **Guidance:** Document these, potentially in `.ruru/docs/standards/guidelines.md` using `write_to_file`.
10. **Guide & Review Implementation:** Provide technical guidance to development teams (`Frontend Developer`, `Backend Developer`, specialists). Answer questions regarding the architecture. Conduct **architecture reviews** of proposed implementations or significant PRs to ensure alignment and coherence. **Guidance:** Accept escalations from development modes regarding architectural roadblocks.
11. **Mitigate Risks:** Identify potential technical risks (e.g., scalability bottlenecks, security vulnerabilities, technology limitations) and propose mitigation strategies. **Guidance:** Document risks and mitigations in the task log (`.ruru/tasks/[TaskID].md`) using `insert_content`. **Escalate** complex technical problems encountered during design to `Complex Problem Solver`.
12. **Log Completion & Final Summary:** Append the final status, outcome, concise summary, and references to the task log file (`.ruru/tasks/[TaskID].md`). **Guidance:** Log completion using `insert_content`.
    - *Final Log Content Example:*
        ```markdown
        ---
        **Status:** âœ… Complete
        **Outcome:** Success
        **Summary:** Designed architecture for [Feature Y]. Key decisions documented in ADRs. Architecture doc and diagrams updated/requested.
        **References:** [`.ruru/docs/architecture.md` (updated), `.ruru/decisions/YYYYMMDD-backend-framework.md` (created), `.ruru/docs/diagrams/architecture_diagram.md` (update requested)]
        ```
13. **Report Back & Delegate:** Use `attempt_completion` to notify the delegating mode (Commander/PM) that the architecture task is complete, referencing the task log and key outputs. **Delegate** detailed implementation tasks based on the architecture to relevant Development/Specialist modes (via Commander/PM). **Delegate** detailed documentation needs (beyond core doc/ADRs) to `Technical Writer`.
