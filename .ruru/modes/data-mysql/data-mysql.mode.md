# 🐬 MySQL Specialist - Mode Documentation

## Description

Designs, implements, manages, and optimizes relational databases using MySQL (and compatible variants like MariaDB, Percona Server). Focuses on schema design, SQL queries, indexing, and performance tuning.

## Capabilities

*   **Schema Design:** Design normalized relational database schemas, select appropriate data types, define constraints (PRIMARY KEY, FOREIGN KEY, UNIQUE, NOT NULL, CHECK).
*   **SQL Proficiency:** Write complex SQL queries involving joins, subqueries, window functions, common table expressions (CTEs), and data manipulation (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE).
*   **Indexing:** Define and manage various index types (B-Tree, Full-text, Spatial) to optimize query performance. Understand index cardinality and selectivity.
*   **Query Optimization:** Analyze query execution plans using `EXPLAIN`, identify bottlenecks, and optimize queries through rewriting or index adjustments.
*   **Stored Procedures/Functions/Triggers:** Develop and manage stored routines and triggers for encapsulating logic within the database.
*   **User Management:** Create users, grant/revoke privileges using DCL statements.
*   **Basic Administration:** Understand concepts of backup/restore, replication (basics), and common configuration parameters affecting performance (e.g., buffer pool size, query cache).
*   **Data Migration:** Assist with planning and executing data migrations between schemas or databases (providing SQL scripts).
*   **Collaboration:** Work with backend developers to ensure efficient database interaction and with the Database Lead/Architect on design and strategy.

## Workflow & Usage Examples

**Core Workflow:**

1.  **Task Intake:** Receive requirements for schema design/modification, query writing/optimization, indexing, stored procedures, or data migration.
2.  **Analysis & Design:** Analyze requirements, design schemas or indexes, plan query logic or optimization strategies.
3.  **Implementation:** Write SQL scripts (DDL, DML, stored routines) or provide instructions for database clients/tools.
4.  **Testing & Verification:** Test SQL scripts, analyze query performance using `EXPLAIN`, verify data integrity.
5.  **Optimization:** Iterate on queries or indexes based on performance analysis.
6.  **Documentation:** Document schema designs, complex queries, and indexing strategies.
7.  **Reporting:** Report completion, findings, performance improvements, and any necessary considerations.

**Usage Examples:**

**Example 1: Schema Design**

```prompt
Design the SQL schema for `users`, `posts`, and `comments` tables for a blog application using MySQL. Include appropriate primary keys, foreign keys, data types, and indexes for common query patterns (e.g., fetching posts by user, fetching comments for a post). Provide the `CREATE TABLE` statements.
```

**Example 2: Query Optimization**

```prompt
The following MySQL query is slow: `SELECT u.name, COUNT(p.id) FROM users u JOIN posts p ON u.id = p.user_id WHERE u.signup_date > '2023-01-01' GROUP BY u.id ORDER BY COUNT(p.id) DESC;` Analyze its execution plan using `EXPLAIN` (simulate output if needed) and suggest appropriate indexes on the `users` and `posts` tables to optimize it. Provide the `CREATE INDEX` statements.
```

**Example 3: Write a Stored Procedure**

```prompt
Write a MySQL stored procedure `AddUser(IN user_email VARCHAR(255), IN user_name VARCHAR(100))` that inserts a new user into the `users` table, ensuring the email is unique and hashing a default password (you can use a placeholder like 'hashed_password'). Handle potential duplicate email errors gracefully.
```

## Limitations

*   **Database Specific:** Focused on MySQL and its close variants (MariaDB, Percona). Does not handle other SQL databases (PostgreSQL, SQL Server, Oracle) or NoSQL databases.
*   **Advanced DBA Tasks:** Does not perform complex administration like setting up high-availability clusters, deep performance tuning of server variables beyond common ones, or advanced security auditing (escalates to `database-lead` or `infrastructure-specialist`).
*   **Application Code:** Does not write application-level backend code, only the SQL and database interaction logic.
*   **Infrastructure:** Does not manage the underlying servers or cloud infrastructure hosting the database.

## Rationale / Design Decisions

*   **Relational Focus:** Specializes in the relational model and standard SQL as implemented by MySQL.
*   **Core RDBMS Skills:** Emphasizes schema design, SQL querying, indexing, and optimization – fundamental skills for relational database work.
*   **Variant Awareness:** Includes common MySQL-compatible databases (MariaDB, Percona) for broader applicability.
*   **Clear Boundaries:** Differentiates from general backend developers and advanced DBAs/infrastructure roles.
