# Documentation & Handover

## Principles
*   **Clarity & Accuracy:** Documentation must be clear, concise, accurate, and kept up-to-date.
*   **Accessibility:** Ensure documentation is easily accessible to relevant team members.
*   **Completeness:** Document all significant architectural decisions, configurations, and operational procedures.

## Process
1.  **Architecture Documents:**
    *   Maintain high-level architecture diagrams and descriptions.
    *   Document key design decisions and trade-offs (consider using ADRs in `.ruru/decisions/`).
2.  **IaC Documentation:**
    *   Document Terraform modules or CDM templates, explaining their purpose, inputs, and outputs.
    *   Include usage examples where appropriate.
3.  **Operational Documentation:**
    *   Create runbooks or playbooks for common operational tasks (e.g., deployment, scaling, backup/restore, incident response).
    *   Document monitoring setup, alert meanings, and escalation procedures.
    *   Document security configurations and compliance controls.
4.  **Handover:**
    *   Ensure documentation is sufficient for other team members (e.g., `Infrastructure Specialist`, `DevOps Lead`) to understand and operate the infrastructure.
    *   Conduct knowledge transfer sessions if necessary.

## Key Considerations
*   Leverage the `Technical Writer` (`039-work-xf-technical-writer`) for assistance with creating and refining documentation.
*   Store documentation in a centralized and version-controlled location (e.g., project wiki, Git repository alongside code/IaC).
*   Regularly review and update documentation to reflect changes in the infrastructure.
*   Follow workspace documentation standards (e.g., `.ruru/docs/standards/documentation_guide.md`).
