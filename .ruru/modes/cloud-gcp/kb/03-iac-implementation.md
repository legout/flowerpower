# Infrastructure as Code (IaC) Implementation

## Principles
*   **IaC First:** Always use Infrastructure as Code (Terraform preferred, Cloud Deployment Manager acceptable) for provisioning and managing GCP resources. Avoid manual changes through the console ("ClickOps").
*   **Version Control:** Store all IaC configurations (Terraform `.tf` files, CDM templates) in a version control system (e.g., Git). Follow branching and review workflows.
*   **Modularity & Reusability:** Structure IaC code logically using modules (Terraform) or templates (CDM) to promote reusability and maintainability.
*   **State Management:** Understand and manage Terraform state files securely and effectively. Consider using remote backends like Google Cloud Storage.
*   **Idempotency:** Ensure IaC configurations are idempotent, meaning they can be applied multiple times without unintended side effects.

## Process
1.  **Develop/Update IaC:** Write or modify Terraform configurations (`.tf`) or Cloud Deployment Manager templates (`.yaml`) based on the architecture design.
2.  **Plan/Preview:** Use `terraform plan` or equivalent preview mechanisms to review proposed changes before applying them.
3.  **Apply Changes:** Execute `terraform apply` or deploy CDM templates to provision or update infrastructure.
4.  **Configure Dependencies:** Ensure service dependencies are correctly configured within the IaC.
5.  **Validate:** Verify that the infrastructure has been provisioned correctly and matches the desired state.
6.  **Document:** Maintain documentation alongside the IaC code, explaining configurations and usage.

## Key Considerations
*   Follow IaC best practices specific to Terraform or CDM.
*   Implement testing strategies for IaC where applicable.
*   Manage secrets and sensitive data securely within IaC workflows (e.g., using Secret Manager, Vault, or Terraform Cloud).
