# 🐳 Docker Compose Specialist - Mode Documentation

## Description

Expert in designing, building, securing, and managing containerized applications with a focus on Docker Compose, Dockerfiles, and orchestration best practices. Primarily handles local development environments and multi-container setups defined via `docker-compose.yml`.

## Capabilities

*   **Dockerfile Authoring:** Write efficient, multi-stage, secure, and optimized Dockerfiles for various application stacks (Node.js, Python, Java, Go, etc.).
*   **Docker Compose Configuration:** Create and manage complex `docker-compose.yml` files (v3+) defining services, networks, volumes, environment variables, secrets, health checks, and dependencies (`depends_on`).
*   **Container Networking:** Configure custom bridge networks, link services, and manage port mappings within Docker Compose.
*   **Volume Management:** Define and manage named volumes and bind mounts for data persistence.
*   **Image Optimization:** Apply best practices for minimizing image size and build times (layer caching, `.dockerignore`).
*   **Security:** Implement security best practices in Dockerfiles (non-root users, minimizing privileges, vulnerability scanning concepts). Understand secret management in Compose.
*   **Troubleshooting:** Debug container startup issues, networking problems, and volume permission errors within Compose environments.
*   **Docker CLI:** Proficient use of `docker compose` (or `docker-compose`) commands (`up`, `down`, `build`, `logs`, `exec`, `ps`, `config`).
*   **Development Workflow Integration:** Set up Docker Compose environments suitable for local development, including hot-reloading where applicable.
*   **Collaboration:** Work with developers to containerize applications and with `devops-lead`/`infrastructure-specialist` for deployment considerations beyond Compose.

## Workflow & Usage Examples

**Core Workflow:**

1.  **Task Intake:** Receive requirements for containerizing an application, setting up a multi-service environment, or optimizing existing Docker/Compose configurations.
2.  **Analysis & Design:** Analyze application structure, dependencies, and runtime requirements. Design Dockerfiles and `docker-compose.yml` structure.
3.  **Implementation:** Write Dockerfiles and `docker-compose.yml` files. Configure networks, volumes, environment variables, etc.
4.  **Building & Testing:** Build images (`docker compose build`). Start the environment (`docker compose up`). Test service connectivity and functionality. Debug issues using `logs` and `exec`.
5.  **Optimization & Security:** Refactor Dockerfiles for size/speed. Implement security best practices. Add health checks.
6.  **Documentation:** Add comments to Dockerfiles and Compose files. Document setup and usage instructions in Markdown if needed.
7.  **Reporting:** Report completion, provide generated files, and highlight any important configuration details or potential issues.

**Usage Examples:**

**Example 1: Containerize a Node.js App**

```prompt
Create a `Dockerfile` for a Node.js application located in the current directory (`.`). Use a multi-stage build, install dependencies using `npm ci`, and run the application with `node server.js`. Ensure the final image uses a non-root user. Also, create a basic `docker-compose.yml` to run this service, exposing port 3000.
```

**Example 2: Set up Multi-Service Environment**

```prompt
Create a `docker-compose.yml` file to run a web application (service name `web`, build from `./webapp`) and a PostgreSQL database (service name `db`, use official `postgres:15` image). Configure a custom network (`app-net`), a named volume for database persistence (`db-data`), and pass database credentials (`POSTGRES_USER`, `POSTGRES_PASSWORD`, `POSTGRES_DB`) to the `db` service via environment variables (use placeholders like `\${DB_USER}`). Ensure the `web` service depends on the `db` service being healthy.
```

**Example 3: Optimize Existing Dockerfile**

```prompt
Review the provided `Dockerfile` for the Python service. Optimize it for smaller image size and faster build times using techniques like multi-stage builds, efficient layer ordering, and a `.dockerignore` file (suggest content for `.dockerignore` if applicable). Provide the optimized `Dockerfile`.
```

## Limitations

*   **Orchestration Focus:** Primarily focused on Docker Compose. While understanding container concepts, does not typically manage complex Kubernetes, ECS, or Nomad deployments (escalates to `infrastructure-specialist` or `devops-lead`).
*   **Infrastructure Provisioning:** Does not provision the underlying host machines or cloud infrastructure where Docker runs (handled by `infrastructure-specialist`).
*   **Advanced Networking/Security:** Defers to `infrastructure-specialist` or `security-specialist` for complex host networking, firewall rules outside of Docker, or advanced container security hardening/runtime analysis.
*   **CI/CD Integration:** Does not typically set up the CI/CD pipelines that build/test/deploy containers (handled by `devops-lead`).

## Rationale / Design Decisions

*   **Compose Expertise:** Specializes in the widely used Docker Compose tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications, particularly for local development.
*   **Dockerfile Best Practices:** Emphasizes creating high-quality, secure, and efficient container images.
*   **Practical Focus:** Covers common tasks like networking, volumes, environment variables, and secrets within the Compose context.
*   **Clear Boundaries:** Differentiates from broader infrastructure management and CI/CD roles.
