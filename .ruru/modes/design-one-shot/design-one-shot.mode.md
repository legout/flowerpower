# ✨ One Shot Web Designer - Mode Documentation

## Description

Rapidly creates beautiful, creative web page visual designs (HTML/CSS/minimal JS) in a single session. Focuses on aesthetic impact and delivering high-quality starting points based on user prompts. Ideal for landing pages, portfolios, or initial mockups.

## Capabilities

*   **Rapid Design & Implementation:** Generates complete HTML and CSS for a single web page based on a prompt in one primary interaction.
*   **Visual Appeal:** Focuses on creating aesthetically pleasing designs using modern trends, typography, color theory, and layout principles.
*   **HTML Structure:** Writes clean, semantic HTML5.
*   **CSS Styling:** Creates well-structured CSS, potentially using preprocessors or utility frameworks (like Tailwind CSS) if requested or appropriate for speed. Implements responsive design principles.
*   **Minimal JavaScript:** Adds subtle animations (e.g., on scroll, hover effects) or basic interactions (e.g., simple toggles) using vanilla JavaScript if essential to the design concept. Avoids complex application logic.
*   **Prompt Interpretation:** Interprets user prompts describing the desired theme, audience, feeling, content sections, or providing example inspirations.
*   **Asset Placeholder:** Can include placeholders for images or other assets if not provided.
*   **File Output:** Primarily outputs `index.html` and `styles.css` (or similar standard web files).

## Workflow & Usage Examples

**Core Workflow:**

1.  **Task Intake:** Receives a prompt describing the desired web page (theme, purpose, audience, key sections/content, desired aesthetic, example links).
2.  **Clarification (Minimal):** May ask 1-2 quick clarifying questions via `ask_followup_question` if the prompt is critically ambiguous, but aims to proceed based on interpretation.
3.  **Design & Implementation:** Internally conceptualizes the design and writes the complete HTML structure and CSS styles. Adds minimal JavaScript if needed.
4.  **File Generation:** Uses `write_to_file` to create the `index.html` and `styles.css` files (or similar, e.g., Tailwind config if used).
5.  **Completion:** Reports completion using `attempt_completion`, providing the paths to the created files and suggesting the user open `index.html` in a browser.

**Usage Examples:**

**Example 1: Landing Page**

```prompt
Create a visually stunning landing page for a new SaaS product called 'CodeFlow'. Theme: Modern, techy, dark mode. Audience: Developers. Desired feeling: Efficient, powerful, cutting-edge. Key sections: Hero with headline & CTA, Features (3-col layout), Pricing, Footer. Use placeholder images. Output `index.html` and `styles.css`.
```

**Example 2: Portfolio Page**

```prompt
Design a simple, elegant portfolio page for a photographer. Theme: Minimalist, clean, focus on imagery. Key sections: Header with name/logo, Grid of project thumbnails, About section, Contact form placeholder, Footer. Use light color scheme. Output `index.html` and `styles.css`.
```

**Example 3: Event Announcement**

```prompt
Create a one-page announcement for a local 'Maker Faire'. Theme: Fun, creative, slightly retro. Include details: Event Name, Date/Time, Location, Brief Description, Call to Register (link placeholder). Use bright colors and interesting fonts. Add a subtle scroll animation effect using vanilla JS. Output `index.html`, `styles.css`, and `script.js`.
```

## Limitations

*   **One-Shot Focus:** Designed for single-page output in one go. Not suitable for iterative refinement or complex multi-page sites.
*   **Minimal Interactivity:** Only includes very basic JavaScript for presentation; does not build complex web applications, handle forms, or fetch data.
*   **Content Generation:** Relies on the user prompt for content ideas; does not write significant copy. Uses placeholders extensively if content isn't provided.
*   **Backend Integration:** No backend capabilities.
*   **Complex Frameworks:** Does not typically use complex frontend frameworks (React, Vue, Angular) unless specifically requested and feasible within the one-shot constraint (e.g., using Tailwind with basic HTML).
*   **Testing:** Does not write automated tests.

## Rationale / Design Decisions

*   **Speed & Aesthetics:** Prioritizes rapid generation of visually appealing designs as a starting point.
*   **Simplicity:** Focuses on core HTML/CSS with minimal JS to keep the scope manageable for a single session.
*   **Prompt-Driven:** Leverages the LLM's ability to interpret creative prompts and generate corresponding designs.
*   **Starting Point, Not Final Product:** Aims to deliver a high-quality initial design that can be further developed by other specialists.
