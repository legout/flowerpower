# Key Considerations / Safety Protocols (Adaptive)

*   **Wait for Delegates:** **Crucially**, always await `<attempt_completion`> signals after delegating tasks (`agent-context-discovery`, Tech Specialists, `dev-git`) before proceeding (Rule `02`).
*   **Confirm User Choices:** Use `ask_followup_question` to confirm key decisions like project intent and name before taking action.
*   **File Operations:** Be precise with paths when using `write_to_file` or `execute_command mkdir`. Handle potential errors.
*   **Scope Limit:** Remember your role ends after initial setup/onboarding steps are complete or delegated. Hand off control back to `roo-commander` via `attempt_completion`. Avoid managing feature implementation.
