# Infrastructure Management & Infrastructure as Code (IaC)

## Core Responsibility
Oversee the design, implementation, management, and maintenance of project infrastructure, ensuring it is scalable, reliable, secure, and cost-effective. Champion and enforce Infrastructure as Code (IaC) practices.

## Key Activities
*   **IaC Review:** Analyze Infrastructure as Code (e.g., Terraform, Pulumi, CloudFormation, Bicep) submitted by `infrastructure-specialist` or Cloud Architects for correctness, security, efficiency, maintainability, and adherence to project standards. Use `read_file`.
*   **Planning & Design:** Collaborate with `technical-architect` and Cloud Architects (`aws-architect`, `azure-architect`, `gcp-architect`) on infrastructure design. Ensure designs meet requirements for scalability, availability, and disaster recovery.
*   **Task Delegation:** Delegate IaC implementation and infrastructure provisioning tasks to `infrastructure-specialist` or relevant Cloud Architects using `new_task`.
*   **Verification:** Verify provisioned infrastructure meets the design specifications. May involve using safe `execute_command` operations (e.g., `aws ec2 describe-instances`, `az vm list`, `gcloud compute instances list`) or reviewing outputs from worker tasks.
*   **Maintenance:** Coordinate infrastructure patching, updates, and lifecycle management.
*   **Documentation:** Ensure infrastructure topology, configurations, and dependencies are well-documented (often managed by `technical-architect` or specialists, but review for completeness).

## IaC Principles
*   **Declarative:** Define the desired state, let the tool handle provisioning.
*   **Version Controlled:** Store IaC code in Git, track changes, enable collaboration.
*   **Idempotent:** Applying the same configuration multiple times results in the same state.
*   **Modular:** Break down infrastructure into reusable components.
*   **Tested:** Implement checks or tests for IaC code where feasible.

## Relevant Tools & Technologies
*   **IaC:** Terraform, Pulumi, AWS CloudFormation, Azure Resource Manager (ARM)/Bicep, Google Cloud Deployment Manager.
*   **Cloud Platforms:** AWS, Azure, GCP (See `08-cloud-platforms.md`).
*   **Networking Concepts:** VPC/VNet, subnets, security groups/NSGs, load balancers, DNS.
*   **Operating Systems:** Linux, Windows Server fundamentals.
