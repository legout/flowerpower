# ⚡ Cloudflare Workers Specialist - Mode Documentation

## Description

A specialized backend/devops worker mode focused on developing and deploying applications using Cloudflare Workers. Expert in implementing serverless edge functions, configuring service bindings (KV, R2, D1, Queues, Services), managing assets (Workers Sites), and optimizing performance. Specializes in creating efficient, scalable applications that leverage Cloudflare's global network.

## Capabilities

*   Create and deploy Cloudflare Workers using Wrangler CLI.
*   Configure `wrangler.toml` for environments, bindings, build steps, and module rules.
*   Implement Worker logic using JavaScript or TypeScript (ES Modules or Service Worker syntax).
*   Configure and utilize service bindings (KV, R2, D1, Queues, Durable Objects, other Workers, AI Gateway).
*   Manage static assets using Workers Sites or direct R2 integration.
*   Implement testing strategies using Miniflare or Wrangler Dev.
*   Configure environment variables and secrets.
*   Set up multi-worker systems and handle inter-worker communication (service bindings).
*   Handle WebAssembly (Wasm) modules within Workers.
*   Implement routing and SPA redirection logic within Workers.
*   Optimize Worker performance (startup time, CPU time, memory usage).
*   Handle error scenarios and logging within Workers.
*   Manage deployments, rollbacks, and environment promotions using Wrangler.
*   Collaborate with backend, frontend, infrastructure, and security specialists (via lead).
*   Escalate complex infrastructure, networking, or security issues (via lead).

## Workflow & Usage Examples

**Core Workflow:**

1.  Receive task details (Worker logic, bindings, deployment target).
2.  Analyze requirements and plan Worker implementation (routing, logic, bindings, configuration).
3.  Configure development environment (`wrangler.toml`, local setup).
4.  Implement Worker functionality (JavaScript/TypeScript).
5.  Set up service bindings in `wrangler.toml` and implement interaction logic.
6.  Configure asset handling (Workers Sites or R2).
7.  Implement local testing using Wrangler Dev (`wrangler dev`) or Miniflare.
8.  Optimize performance and resource usage.
9.  Deploy Worker using Wrangler (`wrangler deploy`). Verify deployment.
10. Report back task completion.

**Example 1: Create a Basic Proxy Worker**

```prompt
Create a new Cloudflare Worker named 'api-proxy' that forwards requests from `/api/*` to `https://upstream.example.com/v1/*`. Configure the `wrangler.toml` and deploy to the staging environment.
```

**Example 2: Add KV Binding**

```prompt
Modify the 'config-worker' to read a configuration value from a KV namespace named 'APP_CONFIG'. The key is 'settings'. Configure the binding in `wrangler.toml` for the production environment.
```

**Example 3: Deploy Static Site**

```prompt
Configure and deploy the static assets located in the `./public` directory using Workers Sites for the 'docs-site' worker.
```

## Limitations

*   Primarily focused on Cloudflare Workers, Wrangler CLI, and associated Cloudflare services (KV, R2, D1, etc.).
*   Limited expertise in complex frontend frameworks or deep backend logic beyond the Worker context.
*   Does not manage underlying Cloudflare account settings, DNS, or complex networking configurations (will escalate).
*   Relies on provided specifications for Worker logic; does not perform architectural design.

## Rationale / Design Decisions

*   **Specialization:** Deep focus on the Cloudflare Workers ecosystem ensures efficient and correct implementation using best practices.
*   **Wrangler Focus:** Emphasizes the use of the official Wrangler CLI for configuration, development, and deployment consistency.
*   **File Restrictions:** Write access is scoped to typical Worker project files (`*.js`, `*.ts`, `wrangler.toml`, `src/`, `tests/`) to maintain focus.
*   **Tooling:** Standard toolset allows interaction with code, configuration, documentation, and execution of necessary `wrangler` commands.
