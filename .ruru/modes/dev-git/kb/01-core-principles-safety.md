# Core Principles & Safety for Git Manager

This document outlines the core principles and safety guidelines for the Git Manager mode when executing Git commands.

## 1. Core Principles

*   **Verify Context:** Always check the current repository status, branch, and remotes before executing commands to ensure you are operating in the expected context.
    ```bash
    git status
    git branch -v
    git remote -v
    ```
*   **Clear Communication:** Use clear and descriptive commit messages following conventional commit standards where applicable.
    ```bash
    git commit -m "feat: Add user authentication system"
    git commit -m "fix: Correct calculation error in totals"
    ```
*   **Log Operations:** Keep a record of all significant Git operations performed and their outcomes, typically within the associated task journal or log.
*   **Escalate Issues:** If complex conflicts arise, authentication fails, or you encounter unexpected errors, escalate the issue to the user or a relevant specialist rather than attempting risky maneuvers.

## 2. Safety Guidelines

*   **Confirm Destructive Operations:** Always seek explicit confirmation from the user before executing commands that rewrite history or discard data, including:
    *   `git push --force` / `git push --force-with-lease`
    *   `git reset --hard`
    *   `git rebase` (especially on shared/public branches)
    *   `git branch -D` (force delete)
*   **Prefer Safer Alternatives:** When possible, use safer alternatives to destructive commands:
    *   Use `git push --force-with-lease` instead of `git push --force`. It provides a check to ensure the remote branch hasn't been updated by someone else since your last fetch.
    *   Use `git revert` instead of `git reset --hard` for changes that have already been pushed to a shared remote. `revert` creates a new commit that undoes the changes, preserving history.
    *   Prefer `git merge` over `git rebase` for integrating changes on shared/public branches to avoid rewriting shared history.
*   **Backup Before Risky Operations:** Before performing potentially destructive operations like complex rebases or resets, consider creating a backup branch:
    ```bash
    git branch backup/before-rebase-feature-xyz
    ```
*   **Understand Rebase Risks:**
    *   Rebasing rewrites commit history.
    *   **Never rebase commits that have already been pushed to a public/shared repository** unless you are certain you are the only one using the branch or have coordinated with collaborators.
*   **Understand Reset Risks:**
    *   `git reset --hard` discards all uncommitted changes in the working directory and index for tracked files. It can lead to data loss if not used carefully.
*   **Understand Force Push Risks:**
    *   `git push --force` overwrites the remote branch history with your local history. If others have pulled the branch, this will cause significant problems for them.

By adhering to these principles and safety guidelines, the Git Manager can operate effectively and minimize the risk of data loss or repository corruption.
