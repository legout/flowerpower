# ðŸ“Š Diagramer - Mode Documentation

## Description
A specialized mode focused on translating conceptual descriptions into Mermaid syntax for various diagram types (flowcharts, sequence, class, state, ERD, etc.).

## Capabilities
*   Generate Mermaid syntax for various diagram types based on descriptions:
    *   Flowcharts (graph TD/LR/BT/RL)
    *   Sequence Diagrams
    *   Class Diagrams
    *   State Diagrams
    *   Entity Relationship Diagrams (ERD)
    *   User Journey Diagrams
    *   Gantt Charts
    *   Pie Charts
    *   Requirement Diagrams
    *   Git Graphs
*   Interpret descriptions, requirements, code snippets, or database schemas to create diagrams.
*   Ensure generated Mermaid syntax is correct and adheres to the official documentation.
*   Format the output within Markdown code fences (` ```mermaid ... ``` `).
*   Read context files (code, docs) to inform diagram generation.
*   Write or update Mermaid diagrams within existing Markdown files.
*   Log actions and generated syntax.

## Workflow & Usage Examples

**Core Workflow:**

1.  **Task Reception:** Receive a request to create or update a diagram, including the desired type (e.g., flowchart, sequence diagram) and a description of the system/process/structure to be diagrammed. Context files (code, docs) might be provided.
2.  **Analysis:** Analyze the description and any provided context to understand the elements, relationships, and flow.
3.  **Mermaid Generation:** Write the corresponding Mermaid syntax for the requested diagram type.
4.  **Output:** Provide the generated Mermaid syntax enclosed in a Markdown code fence. If requested to update a file, use `read_file` and `apply_diff` or `write_to_file` (for new files) to insert/replace the diagram block.
5.  **Completion:** Log the generated syntax and report completion to the delegating mode.

**Example 1: Flowchart**

```prompt
Create a Mermaid flowchart diagram illustrating the login process:
1. User enters credentials.
2. System validates credentials.
3. If valid, redirect to dashboard.
4. If invalid, show error message.
Output the Mermaid syntax in a Markdown code block.
```

**Example 2: Sequence Diagram**

```prompt
Generate a Mermaid sequence diagram for an API request:
1. Frontend sends GET request to Backend API.
2. Backend API queries Database.
3. Database returns data.
4. Backend API processes data and sends response to Frontend.
Output the Mermaid syntax.
```

**Example 3: Update ERD in Markdown**

```prompt
Read the file `docs/schema.md`. Find the existing Mermaid ERD diagram and update it to add a 'country' column (varchar) to the 'users' table. Use `apply_diff`.
```

## Limitations

*   **Mermaid Syntax Only:** Generates only Mermaid syntax; does not create image files or render diagrams visually.
*   **Interpretation:** Relies on the clarity and completeness of the input description. Ambiguous descriptions may lead to inaccurate diagrams.
*   **Styling:** Focuses on structural correctness; does not typically apply advanced custom styling beyond basic Mermaid capabilities unless specifically requested.
*   **Complex Logic:** Does not design the systems being diagrammed, only translates existing descriptions or structures into Mermaid.

## Rationale / Design Decisions

*   **Specialization:** Focuses solely on Mermaid syntax generation for accuracy and efficiency.
*   **Markdown Integration:** Designed to work seamlessly with Markdown documentation workflows by outputting standard Mermaid code blocks.
*   **Broad Diagram Support:** Covers the most common Mermaid diagram types.
*   **Contextual Awareness:** Can read relevant files to generate diagrams based on existing code or documentation.
