# üêò PHP/Laravel Developer - Mode Documentation

## Description

Builds and maintains web applications using PHP and the Laravel framework, including Eloquent, Blade, Routing, Middleware, Testing, and Artisan.

## Capabilities

*   Develop backend logic with Laravel (Models, Controllers, Middleware, Services, Events, Jobs).
*   Implement frontend with Blade, Livewire, or Inertia.js.
*   Manage database migrations, seeders, and Eloquent ORM.
*   Write and run tests with PHPUnit and Pest.
*   Use Laravel Artisan commands and ecosystem tools (Sail, Breeze, Jetstream).
*   Debug Laravel applications using built-in tools.
*   Optimize Laravel app performance.
*   Collaborate with frontend, database, API, infrastructure, and CI/CD specialists.
*   Process MDTM task files with status updates (if applicable).
*   Log progress, decisions, and results in project journals (if applicable).
*   Escalate complex or out-of-scope tasks appropriately.
*   Handle errors and report completion status.

## Workflow & Usage Examples

**Core Workflow:**

1.  **Task Intake:** Receive task (direct or MDTM), understand requirements, log initial goal.
2.  **Implementation:**
    *   Develop backend logic (Controllers, Models, Services, etc.).
    *   Implement frontend views (Blade, Livewire, Inertia).
    *   Manage database schema (Migrations, Eloquent).
    *   Utilize Artisan commands.
3.  **Testing:** Write and run unit/feature tests (PHPUnit/Pest).
4.  **Debugging & Optimization:** Identify and fix issues, apply performance improvements.
5.  **Collaboration/Escalation:** Coordinate with other specialists or escalate if needed.
6.  **Logging & Reporting:** Log progress/completion, update task status, report back.

**Usage Examples:**

**Example 1: Create a New Feature**

```prompt
Implement a new feature to manage user blog posts. Create a `Post` model, migration, controller with CRUD actions (index, create, store, show, edit, update, destroy), Blade views for listing, creating, and editing posts, and corresponding feature tests using Pest. Ensure routes are defined in `routes/web.php`.
```

**Example 2: Add an Artisan Command**

```prompt
Create a new Artisan command `app:cleanup-old-logs` that deletes log files older than 30 days from the `storage/logs` directory. Register the command and ensure it handles potential errors gracefully.
```

**Example 3: Refactor Eloquent Queries**

```prompt
The `ProductController@index` method has inefficient Eloquent queries causing N+1 problems. Refactor the query to use eager loading (`with()`) to optimize performance. Verify the fix with Laravel Debugbar or similar tools.
```

## Limitations

*   Primarily focused on the Larevel framework and its core ecosystem (Eloquent, Blade, Artisan, PHPUnit/Pest, common packages like Sail, Breeze, Jetstream, Livewire, Inertia).
*   May require assistance for highly complex frontend JavaScript implementations beyond standard Blade/Livewire/Inertia integration.
*   Does not handle advanced database administration or complex query optimization beyond standard Eloquent practices (will escalate to `database-specialist`).
*   Does not manage infrastructure, CI/CD pipelines, or complex containerization setups (will escalate to `devops-lead`, `infrastructure-specialist`, `cicd-specialist`, `containerization-developer`).
*   Relies on provided specifications; does not perform UI/UX design or high-level architectural planning.

## Rationale / Design Decisions

*   **Specialization:** Deep focus on PHP/Laravel ensures high proficiency within this specific technology stack, leading to efficient and idiomatic code.
*   **Ecosystem Awareness:** Includes knowledge of common Laravel tools and packages (Sail, Breeze, Jetstream, Livewire, Inertia) for practical application development.
*   **Collaboration Model:** Defined escalation paths ensure that tasks requiring specialized knowledge outside of Laravel (e.g., advanced DB, infra, frontend JS) are handled by the appropriate expert modes.
*   **File Access:** Scoped file access aligns with typical Laravel project structures, promoting focused work and preventing unintended modifications.
