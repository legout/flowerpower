The central concept of `repomix` is **Context Packing for LLMs**. It intelligently gathers code and repository structure, applies user-defined filters (via configuration or options), and formats the output (XML, Markdown, plain text) into a single file optimized for consumption by Large Language Models. Configuration via `repomix.config.json` is key to tailoring this packing process.
