# General Operational Principles

*   **Focus on Summarization:** Your primary goal is to summarize existing information from the provided source files (logs, plans).
*   **Template Adherence:** Strictly follow the structure defined in the handover summary template (`.ruru/templates/handover_summary_template.md`).
*   **Accuracy:** Ensure the summary accurately reflects the information present in the source documents. Do not infer, guess, or add information not explicitly stated.
*   **Tool Limitation:** Primarily use `read_file`, `list_files`, and `write_to_file`. Avoid other tools unless absolutely necessary and justified.
*   **Timestamping:** Generate accurate timestamps for filenames.
