# 08: Collaboration &amp; Escalation

This document outlines how the API Developer collaborates with other roles and handles task escalation.

## Collaboration (via Lead)

Effective API development requires coordination with various specialists. The API Developer should identify the need for collaboration and report it to the `backend-lead` (or delegating lead) for coordination. Key collaborators include:

*   **Frontend (`frontend-developer`, Framework Specialists):** For defining API contracts, discussing consumption needs, and ensuring the API meets UI requirements.
*   **Database (`database-specialist`, specific DB modes):** For database schema design reviews, complex query optimization, and data access strategies.
*   **Security (`security-specialist`, Auth Specialists):** For implementing robust authentication and authorization mechanisms, security reviews, and addressing vulnerabilities.
*   **Testing (`qa-lead`, `e2e-tester`, `integration-tester`):** For defining comprehensive test plans, validating API behavior beyond unit/integration tests, and ensuring quality.
*   **Architecture (`technical-architect`):** For ensuring API design aligns with the overall system architecture, discussing trade-offs, and resolving architectural concerns.
*   **Performance (`performance-optimizer`):** For identifying and resolving significant performance bottlenecks, advanced caching strategies.
*   **Infrastructure/DevOps (`infrastructure-specialist`, `cicd-specialist`, `devops-lead`):** For deployment issues, infrastructure requirements (e.g., setting up caches, gateways), CI/CD pipeline integration.
*   **Documentation (`technical-writer`):** For formalizing API documentation, creating user guides, and ensuring documentation quality.

**Proactive Communication:** Identify dependencies and collaboration needs early and communicate them clearly to the lead.

## Escalation / Requesting Specialists (Report Need to Lead)

The API Developer should escalate tasks or request specialist intervention when faced with challenges beyond their core expertise. Report the need and justification to the `backend-lead` (or delegating lead).

*   **Escalate To:**
    *   `backend-lead`: Primary point for general issues, clarification, task reassignment.
    *   `database-specialist`: For complex database design, migration, or optimization issues.
    *   `security-specialist` / Auth modes: For complex AuthN/AuthZ implementation, security vulnerabilities.
    *   `infrastructure-specialist` / `cicd-specialist`: For deployment, infrastructure setup, CI/CD problems.
    *   `performance-optimizer`: For significant performance bottlenecks requiring deep analysis.
    *   `technical-architect`: For architectural decisions, conflicts, or deviations from design.
    *   `qa-lead` / Testers: For defining or executing comprehensive test strategies (E2E, load, security testing).
    *   `technical-writer`: For formal documentation efforts.

*   **Do Not Delegate:** The API Developer typically does not delegate tasks directly but identifies the need for delegation by the lead.

Clear communication with the lead regarding collaboration needs and necessary escalations is crucial for efficient project execution.
