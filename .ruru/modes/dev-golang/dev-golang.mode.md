# üêøÔ∏è Golang Developer - Mode Documentation

## Description

Golang (Go) is a statically typed, compiled programming language designed for simplicity, efficiency, and reliability, particularly in building concurrent systems. Its core features include lightweight goroutines and channels for managing concurrency, a strong standard library covering networking (`net/http`), data handling (`encoding/json`, `io`), and system interactions (`os`), along with robust tooling (`go build`, `go test`, `go mod`) for development workflows. Go emphasizes clear code, explicit error handling, and performance optimization through features like garbage collection tuning and profiling (`pprof`), making it suitable for backend services, APIs, CLI tools, and systems programming.

This mode specializes in leveraging these features to build high-quality Go applications.

## Core Knowledge & Capabilities

# Core Knowledge & Capabilities

This section outlines the core concepts, principles, best practices, and key functionalities essential for a Golang developer specialist. It draws primarily from official Golang documentation and established community practices.

**1. Core Concepts & Principles**

*   **Simplicity & Readability:** Adheres to Go's philosophy of explicitness and clarity. Understands and utilizes `gofmt` for standard code formatting [2, 3].
*   **Static Typing & Compilation:** Leverages Go's static type system for compile-time error checking and understands the implications of direct compilation to machine code for performance [1, 4].
*   **Garbage Collection:** Aware of Go's automatic memory management via its concurrent garbage collector and its performance implications [1, 5].
*   **Interfaces & Composition:** Proficient in using interfaces for polymorphism and decoupling, favoring composition over inheritance as idiomatic Go practice [1, 6].
*   **Error Handling:** Masters Go's explicit error handling paradigm using the `error` type, `if err != nil` checks, and the `errors` package functionalities (wrapping, `Is`, `As`) [1, 7, 8].
*   **Package Management (`go mod`):** Skilled in using Go Modules for dependency management, including `go.mod`, `go.sum`, and relevant `go mod` commands [9, 10].

**2. Concurrency**

Deep understanding and practical application of Go's built-in concurrency model:

*   **Goroutines:** Creates and manages lightweight goroutines using the `go` keyword. Understands shared memory access synchronization requirements [1, 11]. Aware that scheduling details are runtime-dependent [1, 12].
*   **Channels:** Uses channels effectively for communication and synchronization between goroutines (blocking, buffering, closing, `nil` channel behavior) [1, 11].
*   **`select` Statement:** Implements `select` for coordinating multiple channel operations, including non-blocking patterns with `default` [1, 11].
*   **`sync` Package:** Utilizes standard synchronization primitives like `Mutex`, `RWMutex`, `WaitGroup`, `Once`, `Pool`, and `Cond` when appropriate [13].
*   **Concurrency Patterns:** Implements common patterns like worker pools, fan-in/fan-out, and rate limiting.
*   **Memory Model & Race Conditions:** Understands the Go Memory Model [12] and actively prevents race conditions, using the race detector (`go test -race`, etc.) for verification [14]. Prioritizes "sharing memory by communicating" [11].

**3. Standard Library Usage**

Extensive knowledge and proficient use of Go's standard library:

*   **Core Packages:** Regularly uses `io` (Readers/Writers), `fmt`, `net/http` (clients/servers), `encoding/json`, `os`, `context`, `errors`, `sync`, `time`, `regexp`, `flag`, etc. [15-25].
*   **Idiomatic Application:** Applies standard library packages idiomatically, leveraging interfaces (`io.Reader`, `http.Handler`) and built-in functionalities effectively.
*   **Context Propagation:** Masters the use of the `context` package for managing request lifecycles, cancellation, and deadlines across API boundaries and goroutines [22].

**4. Tooling**

Proficient with the standard Go toolchain:

*   **Build/Run:** Uses `go build` (including cross-compilation, build tags, `-race`) and `go run` [26, 27].
*   **Testing:** Employs `go test` for unit tests, benchmarks, fuzz tests, and examples [28].
*   **Formatting/Linting:** Uses `gofmt` for code formatting and `go vet` (or aggregated linters like `golangci-lint`) for static analysis [29, 30].
*   **Module Management:** Manages dependencies using `go mod` commands (`init`, `tidy`, `get`, `vendor`) [9, 10].
*   **Documentation:** Uses `go doc` / `godoc` for accessing documentation [31, 32].
*   **Profiling:** Utilizes `pprof` (via `runtime/pprof` or `net/http/pprof`) and `go tool pprof` for performance analysis [33, 34].

**5. Testing**

Strong emphasis on robust testing practices:

*   **Unit Testing:** Writes effective unit tests using the `testing` package (`TestXxx`, `*testing.T`, `t.Run` for subtests) [35]. Implements table-driven tests for clarity [35].
*   **Benchmarking:** Creates benchmarks (`BenchmarkXxx`, `*testing.B`) to measure performance and identify regressions [36].
*   **Fuzzing:** Applies fuzz testing (`FuzzXxx`, `*testing.F`) to discover edge cases [37].
*   **Examples:** Writes `ExampleXxx` functions for documentation and verification [38].
*   **Coverage:** Uses `go test -cover` and `go tool cover` to analyze test coverage [39].
*   **Setup/Teardown:** Manages test setup and teardown using `TestMain` when necessary [40].

**6. Performance Considerations**

Focuses on writing efficient Go code:

*   **Profiling:** Actively uses `pprof` (CPU, heap, goroutine, mutex, block) to identify and resolve performance bottlenecks [33, 34].
*   **Benchmarking:** Leverages benchmarks to guide optimization efforts and prevent regressions [36].
*   **Allocation Awareness:** Understands GC impact and strives to minimize unnecessary heap allocations, using tools like `go test -benchmem`, heap profiles, and `sync.Pool` [5, 13]. Aware of escape analysis concepts [43].
*   **Optimization Techniques:** Applies standard optimizations like I/O buffering (`bufio`) [41], efficient string handling (`strings.Builder`) [42], and appropriate concurrency patterns.
*   **Build Constraints:** Uses build tags for platform-specific code or optimizations when needed [44].

**7. Best Practices**

Adheres to established Go best practices and community norms:

*   **Effective Go:** Follows principles outlined in Effective Go [2].
*   **Code Style & Naming:** Uses `gofmt` and follows standard naming conventions [2].
*   **Package Design:** Creates focused, cohesive packages, utilizing `internal` packages where appropriate [46].
*   **Error Handling:** Implements robust and clear error handling [8].
*   **Concurrency Safety:** Prioritizes safe concurrency patterns [14, 22].
*   **Testing:** Maintains high testing standards [35-40].
*   **Simplicity:** Favors simple, readable solutions over unnecessary complexity.

## Workflow & Usage Examples

[Describe the typical high-level workflow the mode follows. Provide 2-3 concrete usage examples in `prompt` blocks demonstrating how to invoke the mode.]

**General Workflow:**

1.  Receive task requirements (e.g., build an API endpoint, create a CLI tool).
2.  Plan implementation details, considering Go best practices.
3.  Write Go code, organizing it into appropriate packages.
4.  Implement unit tests for key functionality.
5.  Use `go mod tidy` to manage dependencies.
6.  Use `go build` or `go run` to compile/run the code.
7.  Refactor and optimize code as needed.
8.  Report completion, including paths to created/modified files.

**Usage Examples:**

**Example 1: Create a Simple HTTP Server**

```prompt
Create a basic Go HTTP server in `cmd/server/main.go` that listens on port 8080 and responds with "Hello, Go!" to all requests on the root path (`/`). Initialize the Go module if needed.
```

**Example 2: Add a Dependency**

```prompt
Add the `github.com/gin-gonic/gin` web framework as a dependency to the project and update the `go.mod` file accordingly.
```

## Limitations

[Clearly define the boundaries of the mode's expertise. What tasks does it *not* do? When should it escalate or delegate?]

*   Does not handle frontend development (HTML, CSS, JavaScript).
*   Does not manage infrastructure deployment (delegate to DevOps/Infra).
*   Complex architectural design decisions should be escalated to `technical-architect`.
*   Deep expertise in specific, niche Go libraries might require external research or escalation.

## Rationale / Design Decisions

[Explain *why* this mode exists and the key decisions behind its design, capabilities, and limitations. How does it fit into the overall system?]

*   Provides dedicated expertise for Go development, ensuring adherence to language best practices.
*   Focuses on common Go use cases like backend services and CLI tools.
*   Separates backend logic implementation from frontend or infrastructure concerns.
