Here's an explanation of general Golang best practices, drawing primarily from official documentation like "Effective Go" and related official resources:

### Naming Conventions

Go's naming conventions emphasize clarity and brevity.

*   **General:** Use `MixedCaps` or `mixedCaps` rather than underscores for multi-word names. [1] The length of a name should correspond to its scope; local variables can be very short (e.g., `i` for a loop index), while names used further from their declaration need to be more descriptive. [3] Avoid overly long names; a good doc comment is often better. [1]
*   **Packages:** Package names should be short, concise, evocative, lowercase, and single-word. Avoid underscores or mixed caps. [1] The name should relate to what the package provides; avoid generic names like `util` or `common` as they are uninformative and can cause import conflicts. [2] Clients refer to package contents using the package name (e.g., `bytes.Buffer`), so choose names that sound natural. [1, 6] By convention, the package name is the base name of its source directory. [6]
*   **Interfaces:** One-method interfaces are often named by the method name plus an "-er" suffix (e.g., `Reader`, `Writer`, `Formatter`). Honor canonical method names like `Read`, `Write`, `Close` and their signatures/meanings. [1]
*   **Getters:** Avoid the prefix `Get` for getter methods. Exporting a field using an uppercase name provides the necessary distinction (e.g., use `owner.Name()` instead of `owner.GetName()`). [6, 10]
*   **Functions/Methods:** Functions returning something often have noun-like names. Functions performing an action often have verb-like names. [2]
*   **Variables:** Short variable names (like `c` instead of `lineCount`, `i` instead of `sliceIndex`) are preferred, especially for local variables with limited scope. [3] Boolean variables often start with `Has`, `Is`, `Can`, or `Allow`. [6]
*   **Constants:** While some sources suggest all caps with underscores (like `INT_MAX`) [6], the standard library and `Effective Go` often use `MixedCaps` for exported constants (e.g., `math.Pi`). Consistency within your project is key.
*   **Error Variables:** Names of error variables often start with `Err` or `err`. [10]

### Error Handling

Go treats errors as regular values. Functions often return an error as their last return value.

*   **Checking Errors:** Do not ignore errors using the blank identifier (`_`). Check returned errors explicitly. Handle the error, return it (possibly wrapped), or, in truly exceptional cases, panic. [3]
*   **Error Strings:** Error messages should typically not be capitalized or end with punctuation, as they are often combined with other context (e.g., `fmt.Errorf("something bad")`). [3]
*   **Adding Context (Wrapping):** Since Go 1.13, use `fmt.Errorf` with the `%w` verb to wrap an error, adding context while preserving the original error. This allows callers to inspect the underlying error chain. [8, 22, 33]
    ```go
    // Example from Google Go Style Guide Best Practices [2]
    if err != nil {
        return fmt.Errorf("couldn't find remote file: %w", err)
    }
    ```
*   **Checking Error Values (`errors.Is`):** To check if an error in a chain matches a specific sentinel error value (e.g., `io.EOF`), use `errors.Is(err, target)`. This replaces direct comparison (`err == target`) to correctly handle wrapped errors. [36, 40]
    ```go
    // Example adapting from Go Wiki FAQ [36]
    if errors.Is(err, io.ErrUnexpectedEOF) {
        // handle unexpected EOF
    }
    ```
*   **Checking Error Types (`errors.As`):** To check if an error in a chain matches a specific type (and potentially extract it), use `errors.As(err, &target)`. This replaces type assertions (`if e, ok := err.(*os.PathError); ok`) to correctly handle wrapped errors. [36, 41]
    ```go
    // Example adapting from Go Wiki FAQ [36]
    var pathErr *fs.PathError
    if errors.As(err, &pathErr) {
        // pathErr now holds the *fs.PathError value
        // handle path error specifically
    }
    ```
*   **Panic:** Use `panic` only for truly exceptional situations (e.g., impossible states, unrecoverable errors like out-of-memory) where the program cannot reasonably continue. Do not use `panic` for ordinary error handling. [3, 5] Use `defer` to manage resource cleanup, as it executes even if a panic occurs. [5]

### Package Structure

Go's package structure recommendations aim for clarity and maintainability.

*   **Simplicity First:** Start simple, often with just a `main.go` and `go.mod`. Don't over-structure small projects. [20]
*   **Package per Directory:** Generally, code within a directory belongs to the same package. [6, 23] Create new directories (and thus packages) when you have a specific, cohesive reason, not just for organization. [17]
*   **`internal` Directory:** Code in an `internal` directory can only be imported by code within the same module subtree (sibling directories or their children). This is useful for hiding implementation details not meant for external use. [20, 23]
*   **`cmd` Directory:** For projects with multiple executables, it's common practice to place each `main` package in a subdirectory under `cmd/`. [17, 23]
*   **Avoid Generic Packages:** As mentioned in Naming, avoid packages named `util`, `common`, etc. Group code by functionality. [2]
*   **Standard Layouts:** The official Go documentation describes common layouts (basic package, basic command, multiple commands, server project). Using these as a starting point is recommended. [17, 23, 25]
*   **File Organization:** There's no strict "one type per file" rule. Group related code within files in a package. Files can be organized by responsibility (e.g., `reader.go`, `writer.go` in `package csv`). [2] A `doc.go` file can optionally hold package-level documentation. [2]

### Formatting (`gofmt`/`goimports`)

Consistent formatting is crucial for readability and is largely automated in Go.

*   **`gofmt`:** This tool automatically formats Go source code according to standard Go style (indentation, spacing, alignment, etc.). It's included with the Go distribution. Run it regularly, often via editor integrations on save. [18, 28, 34]
*   **`goimports`:** This tool does everything `gofmt` does, plus it automatically adds missing import statements and removes unused ones. It also groups imports (standard library first, then third-party). It's the recommended tool to use instead of plain `gofmt`. [3, 22, 34, 37, 39]
*   **Enforcement:** Consistent formatting is strongly encouraged, and many projects enforce `gofmt`/`goimports` compliance in CI pipelines. [18]

### Simplicity

Go values simplicity and readability.

*   **Clear over Clever:** Write code that is straightforward and easy to understand. Avoid unnecessary complexity.
*   **Readability:** Code is read more often than it is written. Optimize for the reader. `Effective Go` provides many tips for writing clear, idiomatic code. [30]
*   **Minimalism:** Go has a relatively small set of features, encouraging simpler solutions.

### Interfaces

Interfaces in Go define behavior (sets of methods) and are implemented implicitly.

*   **Implicit Implementation:** A type satisfies an interface simply by implementing all its methods; no explicit `implements` keyword is needed. This promotes loose coupling. [21, 24]
*   **Define Interfaces on the Consumer Side:** Generally, interfaces should belong to the package that *uses* the interface values, not the package that *implements* them. The implementing package should return concrete types (structs or pointers). This allows implementations to evolve without breaking consumers. [3, 18, 21]
*   **Keep Interfaces Small:** Prefer small, focused interfaces (often with just one method, following the "-er" naming convention). This aligns with the Interface Segregation Principle. [7, 13] Complex behaviors can be built by composing multiple small interfaces. [13]
*   **Accept Interfaces, Return Structs:** A common guideline is for functions/methods to accept interface types as parameters (for flexibility) but return concrete struct types (allowing evolution). [18]
*   **Empty Interface (`interface{}` or `any`):** Use the empty interface sparingly, as it bypasses static type checking. Prefer specific interfaces when possible. [21]

### Avoiding Globals

Global variables can introduce hidden dependencies, make testing difficult, and complicate reasoning about program state, especially with concurrency.

*   **Limit Scope:** Define variables in the narrowest scope possible. [19]
*   **Pass Dependencies:** Instead of relying on global variables (like database connections or loggers), pass them as explicit dependencies to the functions or types (structs) that need them. This makes dependencies clear and improves testability (Dependency Injection). [11, 15]
*   **When Globals Might Be Acceptable:**
    *   Truly global, immutable constants are generally fine. [35]
    *   Immutable configuration set once at startup might be acceptable. [31]
    *   Some cross-cutting concerns like standard logging or tracing are sometimes handled via global accessors, though even these can often be injected. [31]
*   **Concurrency Issues:** Mutable global variables require careful synchronization (e.g., using mutexes) to prevent race conditions if accessed concurrently. This adds complexity. [11, 19]
*   **Testing:** Globals make unit testing harder, as tests can interfere with each other through shared global state. Passing dependencies allows for easy mocking/stubbing in tests. [15, 31]
