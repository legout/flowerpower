Golang (Go) is a statically typed, compiled programming language designed for simplicity, efficiency, and reliability, particularly in building concurrent systems. Its core features include lightweight goroutines and channels for managing concurrency, a strong standard library covering networking (`net/http`), data handling (`encoding/json`, `io`), and system interactions (`os`), along with robust tooling (`go build`, `go test`, `go mod`) for development workflows. Go emphasizes clear code, explicit error handling, and performance optimization through features like garbage collection tuning and profiling (`pprof`), making it suitable for backend services, APIs, CLI tools, and systems programming.
