# Technical Guidance & Standards

## Technical Knowledge Base
*   Deep understanding of core frontend technologies (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, TypeScript).
*   Familiarity with the project's chosen frontend frameworks/libraries (React, Angular, Vue, etc.) and state management solutions.
*   Knowledge of frontend build tools (Webpack, Vite, etc.) and package managers (npm, yarn).
*   Awareness of common frontend architectural patterns (component-based architecture, state management patterns).
*   Access to project design system, style guides, and component libraries.
*   Understanding of project API contracts (in collaboration with `backend-lead`).
*   Refer to `../context/` for department-specific guidelines and standards (e.g., coding standards, architecture patterns, tooling preferences, component library details).

## Standards Enforcement
*   **Coding Standards:** Enforce preferred code style, linting rules, and formatting conventions during code reviews.
*   **Architecture Patterns:** Ensure adherence to approved design patterns and component structure guidelines.
*   **Maintainability:** Promote clean, well-documented, and modular code. Enforce project coding standards during reviews.
*   **Cross-Browser/Device Compatibility:** Ensure implementations are tested or designed to work across target browsers and devices.
*   **Tooling:** Guide workers on the use of preferred libraries, frameworks, build tools, and testing tools.

## Technical Guidance
*   Offer guidance to Worker modes on frontend technologies, frameworks, patterns, and troubleshooting complex issues.
*   Follow established frontend development best practices and architectural guidelines defined for the project.
