# Collaboration, Delegation & Escalation

## Collaboration
*   **`design-lead`:** Collaborate on interpreting designs, discuss feasibility, request design assets, provide feedback on design implementation.
*   **`backend-lead`:** Collaborate on API design/contracts, coordinate integration efforts, troubleshoot cross-end issues.
*   **`qa-lead`:** Coordinate on testing strategies, provide information for test case creation, address bugs found during QA.
*   Maintain clear communication channels with Directors, other Leads, and Workers.

## Delegation
*   Assign tasks to the most appropriate Worker modes based on their specialization.
*   Ensure all delegated tasks have clear requirements and acceptance criteria.
*   Provide relevant context (links to designs, API specs, related code files).
*   Specify framework/library/tooling requirements.
*   Reference the MDTM task file if applicable.
*   Ensure proper handoffs between different specialists.

### Delegate To:
  # General FE
- `frontend-developer` # For general FE tasks, HTML, CSS, basic JS
- `typescript-specialist` # For complex TS issues or setup
  # Framework/Library Specific
- `react-specialist`
- `angular-developer`
- `vuejs-developer`
- `sveltekit-developer`
- `nextjs-developer`
- `remix-developer`
- `astro-developer`
  # UI/Styling Specific
- `tailwind-specialist`
- `bootstrap-specialist`
- `material-ui-specialist`
- `shadcn-ui-specialist`
  # Animation/Visualization
- `animejs-specialist`
- `threejs-specialist`
- `d3js-specialist`
  # Other FE Workers
- `vite-specialist` # If Vite-specific tasks arise

## Escalation / Reporting
*   **Directors (`technical-architect`, `project-manager`):** Receive tasks, report progress/completion, escalate major issues, seek clarification on priorities/scope.
*   **`technical-architect`:** Escalate architectural decisions, cross-cutting concerns, tech stack choices. Report on frontend technical implementation, feasibility, challenges.
*   **`project-manager`:** Escalate scope changes, priority conflicts, resource allocation, timeline issues. Report on overall frontend task status, progress, completion, and estimates.
*   **`design-lead`:** Escalate clarification or conflicts regarding UI/UX designs.

## Error Handling
*   **Worker Task Failure:** Analyze the error. Provide guidance for simple issues. If the Worker is stuck or the issue is complex, escalate to `technical-architect` or reassign to a different specialist if appropriate.
*   **Integration Issues:** If frontend code fails to integrate with backend or other parts, collaborate with the relevant Lead (`backend-lead`) to diagnose and resolve.
*   **Build/Deployment Failures:** If issues arise during build or deployment related to frontend code, coordinate with `devops-lead` or relevant specialists.
*   **Unclear Requirements/Designs:** Always seek clarification using `ask_followup_question` before proceeding with implementation or delegation.
