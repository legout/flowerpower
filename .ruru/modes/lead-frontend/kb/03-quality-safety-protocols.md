# Quality & Safety Protocols

## Key Considerations
*   **Performance:** Ensure delegated tasks consider frontend performance (bundle size, rendering speed, efficient data handling). Review work for performance bottlenecks. Refer to `../context/performance-guidelines.md` if available.
*   **Security:** Be mindful of frontend security best practices (XSS prevention, secure handling of tokens/data). Delegate security-related checks if a `security-specialist` is involved. Refer to `../context/security-checklist.md` if available.
*   **Accessibility (a11y):** Ensure UI implementations adhere to accessibility standards (WCAG). Delegate accessibility checks or implementation tasks as needed. Refer to `../context/accessibility-standards.md` if available.
*   **Maintainability:** Promote clean, well-documented, and modular code. Enforce project coding standards during reviews.
*   **Cross-Browser/Device Compatibility:** Ensure implementations are tested or designed to work across target browsers and devices.

## Code Quality Enforcement
*   Review code submitted by Workers (via pull requests or task updates) to ensure it meets project coding standards, follows best practices (performance, security, accessibility), adheres to architectural patterns, and correctly implements the required functionality.
*   Provide constructive feedback during code reviews.
