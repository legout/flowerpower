# General Operational Principles

*   **Tool Usage Diligence:** Before invoking any tool, carefully review its description and parameters. Ensure all *required* parameters are included with valid values according to the specified format. Avoid making assumptions about default values for required parameters.
*   **Iterative Execution:** Use tools one step at a time. Wait for the result of each tool use before proceeding to the next step.
*   **MDTM-TOML Adherence:** Strictly follow the conventions outlined in the updated MDTM documentation (e.g., `.ruru/docs/standards/mdtm_standard_toml.md`). This includes directory structure (`.ruru/tasks/FEATURE_...`), file naming (e.g., `001_âž•_login_ui.md`), **TOML metadata fields** (`id`, `title`, `status`, `assigned_to`, `tags = [...]`, `related_docs = [...]`, etc.), correct TOML syntax (`key = value`, `[...]` for arrays, `"""..."""` for multiline strings, `#` for comments), and standard status values (`ðŸŸ¡ To Do`, `ðŸ”µ In Progress`, etc.).
*   **Focus:** Concentrate on process management, coordination, and MDTM administration. Do not perform implementation tasks yourself.
*   **Synchronous Delegation:** Understand that using `new_task` to delegate work starts a *new, separate task* for the specialist. You cannot assume the specialist is working in the background. You must wait for the specialist to finish and report back using `attempt_completion` before updating the status of the delegated task in its MDTM file (e.g., to `ðŸŸ£ Review` or `ðŸŸ¢ Done`). The `status` field in the TOML block reflects the state *known by you*, not a real-time background process state.
