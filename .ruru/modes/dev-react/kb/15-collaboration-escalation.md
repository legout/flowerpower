# Collaboration & Escalation

Based on task analysis and the project's Stack Profile, proactively delegate specific sub-tasks or collaborate with other specialists.

## Delegation

Use the `new_task` tool to delegate specific sub-tasks to the most appropriate specialist. Log the delegation (including the new Task ID) in the current task log.

    *   **Styling:** `tailwind-specialist`, `material-ui-specialist`, `bootstrap-specialist`, `css-specialist` (for complex or library-specific styling).
        *   *Example Task:* Implement styling for component X based on design Y.
    *   **Animations:** `animejs-specialist`, `framer-motion-specialist` (for complex animations).
        *   *Example Task:* Implement animation Z for component X.
    *   **Data Visualization:** `d3js-specialist` (for complex charts/graphs).
        *   *Example Task:* Create visualization V for component X.
    *   **Accessibility:** `accessibility-specialist` (for implementation/auditing).
        *   *Example Task:* Ensure component X meets WCAG AA standards / Audit component X.
    *   **Backend/API:** `api-developer`, `[backend_framework]-developer` (e.g., `fastapi-developer`, `django-developer`) (for API creation/modification, complex data fetching logic).
        *   *Example Task:* Create/Modify API endpoint for X / Implement backend logic for Y.
    *   **Build Tools:** `vite-specialist`, `webpack-specialist` (for complex build configurations).
        *   *Example Task:* Configure build tool for feature Z.
    *   **Framework Integration:** `nextjs-developer`, `remix-developer`, `astro-developer` (for framework-specific routing, data fetching, SSR/SSG).
        *   *Example Task:* Integrate component X with framework feature Y.
    *   **Testing:** `e2e-tester`, `integration-tester`, `qa-lead` (for specific testing types beyond component unit/integration tests).
        *   *Example Task:* Write E2E tests for user flow Z.

## Collaboration

Actively collaborate with related specialists during implementation.

*   **Collaborate With:**

    *   Styling Specialists (e.g., `tailwind-specialist`): On integrating styles.
    *   Animation Specialists: On triggering animations.
    *   `accessibility-specialist`: On implementing accessible patterns.
    *   API/Backend Specialists: On API contracts and data fetching.
    *   Testing Modes: On testing strategies and results.
    *   Framework Specialists (e.g., `nextjs-developer`): On framework integration points.
    *   `performance-optimizer`: On identifying and resolving performance issues.

Log significant collaboration points and decisions in the task log.

## Escalation

If blocked or facing issues beyond your scope (e.g., architectural decisions, major requirement changes), escalate to the appropriate lead or manager.

*   **Escalate To:**
    *   `frontend-lead`
    *   `technical-architect`
    *   `project-manager`
    *   `roo-commander`

Clearly document the issue and the reason for escalation in the task log and when reporting status.
