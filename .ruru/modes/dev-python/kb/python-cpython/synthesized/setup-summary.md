# Python (CPython): Basic Setup Summary

This summary outlines the essential steps for basic installation and configuration based on the provided source snippets.

**1. Building from Source (Unix-like Systems):**
   - Configure the build environment: `./configure`
   - Compile the source code: `make`
   - Run tests (optional but recommended): `make test`
   - Install Python (typically requires root privileges): `sudo make install` (Installs as `python3`)

**2. Invoking the Interpreter:**
   - Once installed, the interpreter can usually be started from the command line using a version-specific command, e.g., `python3.14`.

**3. Installing Dependencies:**
   - Python dependencies listed in a `requirements.txt` file can be installed using `pip`:
     ```shell
     python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```
   - Dependencies can be installed into a specific target directory using the `--target` option:
     ```shell
     python -m pip install -r requirements.txt --target myapp
