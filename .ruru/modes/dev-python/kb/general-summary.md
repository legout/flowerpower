Python is a versatile, high-level programming language emphasizing code readability through PEP 8 style guidelines. It offers powerful features like comprehensions and generators for efficient data manipulation and memory management. Key concepts include decorators for modifying function behavior and context managers (`with` statement) for reliable resource handling. Python boasts a rich standard library (including `os`, `sys`, `datetime`, `json`, `logging`) and a robust ecosystem supported by standard development patterns like virtual environments (`venv`) and packaging (`pip`, `pyproject.toml`), enabling tasks such as HTTP requests via libraries like `requests`.
