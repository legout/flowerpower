Basic Python project setup typically involves creating an isolated virtual environment using `python -m venv <env_name>` (e.g., `.venv`). This environment is then activated (activation command varies by OS/shell). Dependencies are installed into the active environment using `pip install <package_name>`, often managed through a `pyproject.toml` file listing project metadata and dependencies.
