# Flask: Security Best Practices

Key considerations for building secure Flask applications.

## Core Principle: Defense in Depth

Security involves multiple layers. Rely on Flask's features, use extensions correctly, and follow secure coding practices.

## Key Areas

1.  **Secret Key Management (`SECRET_KEY`):**
    *   **Purpose:** Used for signing sessions, CSRF tokens, message flashing, etc. Needs to be unpredictable and secret.
    *   **Vulnerability:** If leaked, attackers can forge sessions, bypass CSRF protection, etc.
    *   **Best Practice:**
        *   Generate a long, random key (e.g., using `os.urandom(24)` or `secrets.token_hex(16)`).
        *   **NEVER** hardcode it in your source code or commit it to version control.
        *   Load it from an environment variable (`os.environ.get('SECRET_KEY')`) or a secure configuration management system in production.
        *   Use a different, potentially simpler key for development/testing (but still don't commit it if public repo).

2.  **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):**
    *   **Vulnerability:** Injecting malicious scripts into your site, which then run in other users' browsers.
    *   **Flask/Jinja2 Protection:** Jinja2 auto-escapes HTML characters in variables (`{{ ... }}`) by default.
    *   **Best Practice:**
        *   **Trust Auto-Escaping:** Rely on Jinja2's default behavior.
        *   **Use `|safe` Filter Sparingly:** Only use the `|safe` filter on content you absolutely trust (e.g., generated by Markdown conversion from trusted admin input, *never* directly from user input). Sanitize user-generated HTML before marking it safe.
        *   **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Implement a strict CSP header (via response headers or extensions like Flask-Talisman) to limit where scripts can be loaded from and executed.

3.  **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF):**
    *   **Vulnerability:** Tricking a logged-in user's browser into making an unwanted request to your application (e.g., submitting a form on their behalf).
    *   **Flask-WTF Protection:** The Flask-WTF extension provides automatic CSRF protection for forms.
    *   **Implementation:**
        *   Set `SECRET_KEY`.
        *   Initialize `CSRFProtect(app)` (or `csrf.init_app(app)` in factory).
        *   Include `{{ form.hidden_tag() }}` or `{{ csrf_token() }}` inside every `<form method="post">`.
        *   Use `form.validate_on_submit()` in your view, which includes the CSRF check.
        *   For AJAX requests (POST/PUT/DELETE), fetch the CSRF token (often from a cookie named `csrftoken` or a meta tag) and include it in a request header (e.g., `X-CSRFToken`).

4.  **Input Validation:**
    *   **Vulnerability:** Malicious or malformed input can cause errors, security holes (like SQL injection if not using ORM correctly), or unexpected behavior.
    *   **Best Practice:**
        *   **Validate Everything:** Treat all incoming data (form fields, query parameters, JSON bodies, headers) as untrusted.
        *   **Use Forms (Flask-WTF):** Leverage WTForms validators (`DataRequired`, `Length`, `Email`, `Regexp`, custom validators) for robust validation.
        *   **Type Checking:** Ensure data is of the expected type.
        *   **Sanitization:** Cleanse data before displaying it back (though Jinja2 auto-escaping helps significantly for HTML context).

5.  **SQL Injection:**
    *   **Vulnerability:** Injecting malicious SQL code via user input to manipulate database queries.
    *   **Flask-SQLAlchemy Protection:** Using an ORM like SQLAlchemy (via Flask-SQLAlchemy) inherently protects against most SQL injection vulnerabilities because it uses parameterized queries.
    *   **Best Practice:** **Always use the ORM's query methods** (`filter_by`, `filter`, `get`, etc.) and avoid constructing raw SQL strings with user input. If raw SQL is unavoidable, use parameter binding (`db.session.execute(text("SELECT * FROM users WHERE name = :name"), {"name": user_input})`).

6.  **Session Management:**
    *   **Flask's Secure Cookies:** Flask's default session implementation uses cryptographically signed cookies. The `SECRET_KEY` is crucial here.
    *   **Best Practice:**
        *   Keep `SECRET_KEY` secure.
        *   Consider setting `SESSION_COOKIE_SECURE=True` (requires HTTPS), `SESSION_COOKIE_HTTPONLY=True` (prevents client-side script access), and `SESSION_COOKIE_SAMESITE='Lax'` or `'Strict'` to mitigate CSRF and information leakage.
        *   For server-side sessions (storing data on the server instead of just the client cookie), use extensions like Flask-Session with appropriate backends (Redis, Memcached, SQLAlchemy).

7.  **Dependency Management:**
    *   Keep Flask and all extensions updated to patch known vulnerabilities.
    *   Use tools like `pip-audit` or GitHub Dependabot to scan for vulnerable dependencies.

8.  **Debugging (`DEBUG = False`):**
    *   **Never run with `DEBUG = True` in production.** It exposes sensitive debug information.

9.  **HTTPS:**
    *   Always use HTTPS in production. Configure your web server (Nginx, Apache) or load balancer for TLS termination. Use Flask-Talisman or similar extensions to enforce HTTPS and set security headers (HSTS, CSP, etc.).

Security is an ongoing process. Regularly review Flask security guidelines and OWASP recommendations. Consult with `security-specialist` for complex scenarios.
