# ðŸ”§ Mode Maintainer - Mode Documentation

## Description

Applies specific, instructed modifications to existing custom mode definition files (`*.mode.md`), focusing on accuracy and adherence to the TOML+Markdown format. This mode acts as a precise executor of changes defined by others.

## Capabilities

*   **File Reading:** Reads specified mode definition files (`*.mode.md`) and related templates or rules.
*   **Precise Editing:** Applies exact changes to TOML frontmatter or Markdown content using `apply_diff` or `write_to_file` (for full rewrites if instructed).
*   **Syntax Adherence:** Understands and maintains valid TOML and Markdown syntax within the `+++` delimiters and the main content body.
*   **Instruction Following:** Executes specific instructions accurately (e.g., "change the `summary` field to 'New Summary'", "replace lines 25-30 with this new text").
*   **Verification (Basic):** Can perform basic checks to ensure the applied change matches the instruction.
*   **Tool Usage:** Primarily uses `read_file`, `apply_diff`, and `write_to_file`. May use `ask_followup_question` to clarify ambiguous instructions.

## Workflow & Usage Examples

**Core Workflow:**

1.  **Task Intake:** Receives precise instructions detailing the target file (`*.mode.md`) and the exact changes required (specific field updates, line replacements, content additions/deletions).
2.  **Clarification (If Needed):** If instructions are ambiguous or seem potentially invalid (e.g., invalid TOML syntax requested), use `ask_followup_question` to seek clarification from the delegator.
3.  **Read Target File:** Use `read_file` to get the current content and line numbers if using `apply_diff`.
4.  **Apply Changes:** Use `apply_diff` for targeted changes or `write_to_file` for complete rewrites (only if explicitly instructed). Ensure TOML and Markdown syntax remain valid.
5.  **Reporting:** Report successful application of the changes or any errors encountered during the process.

**Usage Examples:**

**Example 1: Update a TOML Field**

```prompt
Update the `summary` field in `.ruru/modes/dev-react/dev-react.mode.md`. Read the file, find the `summary = "..."` line in the TOML block, and use `apply_diff` to change the value to "Builds modern user interfaces using React and related ecosystem tools."
```

**Example 2: Replace Markdown Section**

```prompt
Replace the entire 'Limitations' section (lines 85-92) in `.ruru/modes/spec-openai/spec-openai.mode.md` with the following new text:

```markdown
## Limitations

*   Requires valid API keys and appropriate quota/billing setup with OpenAI.
*   Knowledge cutoff is based on the underlying model version.
*   May hallucinate or generate inaccurate information; outputs require review.
*   Cost is directly related to token usage.
```

Use `apply_diff` to perform the replacement.
```

**Example 3: Add a Tag**

```prompt
Add the tag "utility" to the `tags` array in the TOML frontmatter of `.ruru/modes/util-git/util-git.mode.md`. Read the file, locate the `tags = [...]` line, and use `apply_diff` to insert the new tag while maintaining the array format.
```

## Limitations

*   **No Interpretation:** Does *not* interpret intent or make independent decisions. Executes instructions literally.
*   **Syntax Errors:** Cannot fix pre-existing syntax errors unless specifically instructed on how to do so. Will likely fail if instructed changes introduce syntax errors.
*   **Scope:** Limited to modifying `*.mode.md` files and potentially related context files if instructed. Does not handle broader code changes or system configuration.
*   **Validation:** Performs only basic validation that the change was applied; does not validate the semantic correctness or impact of the change.

## Rationale / Design Decisions

*   **Executor Role:** Designed as a highly reliable executor for mode definition changes, reducing the risk of errors when modifications are delegated.
*   **Restricted Tools/Scope:** Limited toolset and file access focus the mode on its specific maintenance task.
*   **Emphasis on Accuracy:** The core principle is to apply instructed changes precisely.
