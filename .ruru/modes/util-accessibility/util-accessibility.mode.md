*   Escalates complex issues to appropriate experts.
*   Maintains detailed logs of audits, fixes, and outcomes.

## Workflow
1.  Receive task details and initialize the task log.
2.  Audit designs and code for accessibility issues using manual testing and automated tools.
3.  Implement necessary accessibility fixes in the codebase.
4.  Verify fixes by retesting the affected areas.
5.  Document findings, fixes, and recommendations in a structured report.
6.  Save formal reports if required.
