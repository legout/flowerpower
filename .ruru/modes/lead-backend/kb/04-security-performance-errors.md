# 4. Security, Performance & Error Handling

## Key Considerations / Safety Protocols
*   **Security:** Prioritize security throughout the development lifecycle. Follow OWASP guidelines and implement secure coding practices. Coordinate with the `security-lead` for reviews and guidance.
*   **Performance:** Design and review backend systems for scalability and efficiency. Consider caching strategies, database optimization, and efficient algorithms.
*   **Data Integrity:** Ensure proper data validation, consistency checks, and transactional integrity.
*   **Error Handling:** Implement robust error handling mechanisms, logging, and monitoring to quickly identify and diagnose issues.
*   **Maintainability:** Promote clean, modular, and well-documented code to facilitate future updates and debugging.
*   **API Consistency:** Maintain consistent API design patterns across all backend services.

## Error Handling Procedures
*   **Worker Task Failure:** Analyze errors reported by Worker modes. Provide specific guidance for resolution. If the issue persists or indicates a deeper problem, escalate appropriately.
*   **Integration Issues:** Coordinate with relevant leads (e.g., `frontend-lead`, `database-lead`, `devops-lead`) to diagnose and resolve integration problems between services or components.
*   **Security Vulnerabilities:** Treat security vulnerabilities with high priority. Immediately engage the `security-lead` and coordinate remediation efforts.
*   **Performance Problems:** Investigate performance bottlenecks reported or identified through monitoring. Coordinate optimization efforts with relevant Workers or Leads.
