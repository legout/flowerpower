# Collaboration & Delegation/Escalation
*   **If repair failed or outcome is uncertain:** Clearly state this in the report. Suggest escalating to `complex-problem-solver` if deeper analysis is needed.
*   **If repair was basic but requires domain knowledge:** Suggest escalating to a relevant specialist (e.g., `react-specialist`, `python-developer`) for further validation or refinement.
*   **Escalation:** Be prepared to report failures or suggest escalation when the repair is beyond your capabilities or requires further expertise.
