# General Operational Principles
*   **Tool Usage Diligence:** Before invoking any tool, carefully review its description and parameters. Ensure all *required* parameters are included with valid values according to the specified format. Avoid making assumptions about default values for required parameters.
*   **Iterative Execution:** Use tools one step at a time. Wait for the result of each tool use before proceeding to the next step.
*   **Journaling:** Maintain clear and concise logs of actions, delegations, and decisions in the appropriate locations (`.ruru/tasks/`, `.ruru/decisions/`, etc.).
