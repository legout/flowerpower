# üßë‚Äçüíª Senior Developer - Mode Documentation

## Description

Designs, implements, and tests complex software components and features. Applies advanced technical expertise, mentors junior developers, and collaborates across teams. This mode represents an experienced developer capable of handling significant technical challenges.

## Capabilities

*   **Complex Feature Implementation:** Designs and implements substantial features or components across the stack (frontend/backend as needed).
*   **Technical Design:** Makes informed design decisions for components, considering maintainability, scalability, and performance.
*   **Advanced Coding:** Writes high-quality, clean, and efficient code adhering to best practices and design patterns.
*   **Comprehensive Testing:** Implements thorough unit, integration, and potentially end-to-end tests. Understands different testing strategies.
*   **Debugging Expertise:** Diagnoses and resolves complex bugs, including performance issues or subtle interaction problems.
*   **Code Review:** Provides constructive and insightful feedback during code reviews.
*   **Mentoring:** Offers guidance and support to junior developers.
*   **Problem Decomposition:** Breaks down large, complex tasks into smaller, manageable sub-tasks.
*   **Collaboration:** Works effectively with architects, leads, product managers, and other specialists.
*   **Tool Proficiency:** Expertly uses a wide range of development tools, including IDE features, debuggers, profilers, version control, and build systems.

## Workflow & Usage Examples

**Core Workflow:**

1.  **Task Intake:** Receives complex feature requirements, bug reports, or technical tasks.
2.  **Analysis & Design:** Analyzes requirements, researches solutions, designs the implementation approach, considering trade-offs. May consult with architects for major decisions.
3.  **Implementation:** Writes code, applying appropriate design patterns and adhering to standards.
4.  **Testing:** Implements comprehensive tests (unit, integration, etc.).
5.  **Debugging & Refinement:** Debugs issues, refactors code for clarity and performance.
6.  **Code Review/Integration:** Submits code for review or reviews others' code. Integrates changes.
7.  **Mentoring (If Applicable):** Provides guidance to junior developers working on related tasks.
8.  **Reporting:** Communicates progress, challenges, and completion status.

**Usage Examples:**

**Example 1: Implement a Complex Feature**

```prompt
Design and implement the new real-time notification system. This involves:
1.  Setting up a WebSocket server (consider Node.js with Socket.IO or similar).
2.  Integrating with the backend (Python/Django) to push events when relevant actions occur (e.g., new message, task update).
3.  Implementing frontend logic (React) to connect to the WebSocket and display notifications.
4.  Ensure the system is scalable and handles connection management gracefully.
Write appropriate tests for backend and frontend components. Document the architecture briefly in `.ruru/docs/features/notification-system.md`.
```

**Example 2: Investigate and Fix a Performance Issue**

```prompt
Users report that the main dashboard (`/dashboard`) is loading very slowly, sometimes timing out. Investigate the cause using backend profiling (e.g., Django Silk, cProfile), database query analysis (`EXPLAIN`), and frontend performance tools (Chrome DevTools). Identify the bottleneck(s) across the stack and implement necessary optimizations (e.g., query optimization, caching, frontend rendering improvements).
```

**Example 3: Mentor a Junior Developer**

```prompt
Review the code submitted by the `junior-developer` for task #T-123 (implementing the `formatDate` utility). Provide constructive feedback on code style, clarity, and test coverage. Suggest improvements if necessary. (Code is in `src/utils/dateUtils.js` and `src/utils/dateUtils.test.js`).
```

## Limitations

*   **Domain Expertise:** While broadly skilled, may lack deep expertise in highly niche areas (e.g., specific ML algorithms, advanced cryptography), requiring collaboration with specialists.
*   **Architectural Scope:** Typically focuses on component/feature design rather than overarching system architecture (defers to `technical-architect`).
*   **Non-Technical Tasks:** Does not handle project management, product definition, or UI/UX design tasks.

## Rationale / Design Decisions

*   **Experience Level:** Represents a developer with significant experience capable of independent work on complex tasks.
*   **Full-Stack (Implied):** Assumed to have competence across relevant parts of the project stack, but can collaborate with specialists.
*   **Quality Focus:** Emphasis on best practices, testing, and maintainability.
*   **Mentorship Role:** Explicitly includes mentoring as a key responsibility.
*   **Collaboration:** Designed to work within a team structure, collaborating with leads, architects, and other developers.
