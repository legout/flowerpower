# Directus: Data Modeling & Best Practices

Designing effective collections, fields, and relationships in Directus is crucial for building maintainable and performant applications.

## Core Concept: Structuring Your Data

Data modeling involves defining collections (tables), fields (columns), and the relationships between them to accurately represent your data and support application use cases. Directus provides a user-friendly interface (Data Studio) for modeling, which translates your design into standard SQL database schema elements.

## Collections

*   **Purpose:** Represent the main entities or types of content (e.g., `articles`, `products`, `users`, `categories`).
*   **Naming:** Use plural nouns, typically `snake_case`. Be consistent.
*   **Primary Key:** Directus automatically manages a primary key field (usually `id`).
*   **System Collections:** Avoid naming custom collections with the `directus_` prefix.

## Fields

*   **Purpose:** Represent individual attributes within a collection (e.g., `title`, `publish_date`, `price`).
*   **Naming:** Use consistent naming, often `snake_case`.
*   **Data Type Selection:** Choose the most appropriate underlying SQL data type (String, Integer, Float, Boolean, DateTime, JSON, etc.). This impacts storage, validation, and querying.
*   **Interface Selection:** Choose the best UI interface for content editors (e.g., Text Input, WYSIWYG, DateTime Picker, Select Dropdown, Relational Interface). The interface improves usability but doesn't change the data type.
*   **Required Fields:** Mark fields as required if they must always have a value.
*   **Validation:** Configure validation rules (e.g., min/max length, format checks) on field settings.
*   **Default Values:** Set default values where appropriate.
*   **Indexes:** Add database indexes to fields frequently used in API filters (`filter`), sorting (`sort`), or relationships to improve query performance. Coordinate with `database-specialist` for complex indexing.

## Relationships

Choosing the right relationship type is key:

*   **Many-to-One (M2O):**
    *   **Use Case:** An item belongs to *one* parent item (e.g., an `article` has one `author`).
    *   **Implementation:** Add a field to the "many" collection (`articles`) linking to the "one" collection (`users`). Creates a foreign key.
*   **One-to-Many (O2M):**
    *   **Use Case:** An item can have *many* child items (e.g., a `user` has many `articles`).
    *   **Implementation:** This is the *inverse* of an M2O. Define the M2O field on the "many" side (`articles.author`), and Directus makes the O2M available on the "one" side (`users.articles`).
*   **Many-to-Many (M2M):**
    *   **Use Case:** Items in two collections can be linked freely (e.g., `articles` and `tags`).
    *   **Implementation:** Directus creates a hidden "junction" collection (e.g., `articles_tags`) with foreign keys to both related collections.
*   **Translations (Special O2M):** Use the dedicated "Translations" interface for multilingual content, linking to a separate translations collection.
*   **Files (Special O2M/M2M):** The "File" / "Image" interface uses relationships to the `directus_files` system collection.

## Best Practices

*   **Plan Ahead:** Think about your data structure and relationships before creating collections/fields.
*   **Normalize (Usually):** Avoid excessive data duplication. Use relationships to link related data.
*   **Denormalize (Sometimes):** Cautiously duplicate *small*, frequently needed data for performance-critical reads, but consider caching first.
*   **Use Appropriate Types:** Use correct data types for better validation and querying.
*   **Configure Interfaces:** Choose user-friendly interfaces for content editors.
*   **Set Permissions:** Configure roles and permissions *after* defining your data model.
*   **Consider API Queries:** Think about how data will be filtered, sorted, and queried via the API. Add indexes where needed.
