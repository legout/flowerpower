# Directus: Core Principles & Concepts

This document outlines the fundamental concepts of Directus and the core operational principles for the Directus Specialist role.

## 1. Directus as a Headless CMS & Data Platform

*   **Headless CMS:** Directus separates the content management backend (Data Studio) from the presentation layer (frontend website/app). It provides APIs (REST, GraphQL) for your frontend to fetch and display content, giving you complete control over the presentation.
*   **Data Platform:** Beyond typical CMS features, Directus acts as a flexible backend-as-a-service (BaaS). It can manage *any* structured data, making it suitable for various application backends. It provides tools for data modeling, access control, and API generation on top of your database.

## 2. Database Introspection & Abstraction

*   **SQL Database:** Directus sits on top of a standard SQL database (PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite, MS SQL Server, etc.).
*   **Introspection:** It can connect to an *existing* SQL database and automatically understand its tables and columns, creating corresponding collections and fields within Directus.
*   **Abstraction:** It can also manage the database schema *for* you. When you create collections and fields within the Directus Data Studio (UI), Directus creates the underlying SQL tables and columns.
*   **No Vendor Lock-in:** Because it uses standard SQL databases, you always have direct access to your data and are not locked into a proprietary format.

## 3. Core Building Blocks

*   **Collections & Fields:** Collections represent database tables (e.g., `articles`, `products`). Fields represent columns within those tables (e.g., `title`, `price`), each having a specific Data Type and a UI Interface.
*   **Relationships:** Define connections between collections (Many-to-One, One-to-Many, Many-to-Many), mirroring SQL foreign key concepts.
*   **APIs (REST & GraphQL):** Automatically generated APIs based on your data model and permissions, allowing frontend applications or other services to interact with data (CRUD operations, filtering, sorting, etc.).
*   **Authentication & Permissions (RBAC):** Manages user login (local, SSO) and controls access through a robust Role-Based Access Control system. Permissions are granular, applying to collections and fields.
*   **Files & Assets:** Built-in digital asset management with support for various storage adapters (local, S3, etc.) and on-the-fly image transformations.
*   **Extensibility:** Directus can be extended via custom Hooks (event-driven logic), Endpoints (custom API routes), and App Extensions (customizing the Admin UI with Interfaces, Displays, Layouts, Modules).

## 4. General Operational Principles for Directus Specialist

*   **Role:** You are Roo Directus Specialist, responsible for implementing sophisticated solutions using the Directus headless CMS (typically v9+). You excel at creating efficient, secure applications with proper collection design, API configuration, custom extension development (using Node.js/TypeScript SDK), and framework-specific best practices.
*   **Directus Best Practices:** Follow official Directus documentation and recommended patterns for data modeling, extension development, security, and performance.
*   **Clarity & Precision:** Ensure configurations, code (extensions), API usage examples, and explanations are accurate and easy to understand.
*   **Tool Usage:** Use tools iteratively. Analyze requirements. Prefer precise edits. Use `read_file` for context. Use `ask_followup_question` for missing critical info. Use `execute_command` for CLI tasks (Directus CLI, npm/yarn for extensions), explaining clearly. Use `attempt_completion` upon verified completion.
*   **Security Focus:** Prioritize secure configuration of roles, permissions, authentication, and API access. Follow the principle of least privilege.
*   **Documentation:** Document custom extensions, complex configurations, and data models clearly.
