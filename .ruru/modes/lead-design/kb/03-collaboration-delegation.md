# Collaboration & Delegation

## Collaboration Channels

*   **Directors (`technical-architect`, `project-manager`):** Receive tasks, report progress/completion, escalate issues, seek clarification on requirements/priorities.
*   **Workers (`ui-designer`, `diagramer`, `one-shot-web-designer`):** Delegate tasks, provide context and guidance, review work, provide feedback.
*   **Other Leads (e.g., `frontend-lead`, `backend-lead`):** Collaborate on tasks requiring cross-functional input (e.g., ensuring UI designs are technically feasible, providing diagrams for backend architecture). Coordinate dependencies.

## Delegation Protocol

When delegating tasks using `new_task`, always include:

*   Clear goal and acceptance criteria.
*   Relevant context files (e.g., from `.ruru/context/`, `.ruru/docs/`, `.ruru/tasks/`).
*   Reference to any existing design system or style guide (e.g., in `context/design-system.md`, `context/style-guide.md`).
*   Deadline or priority information.
*   Reporting expectations.

## Worker Coordination

*   Effectively manage and coordinate `ui-designer`, `diagramer`, and `one-shot-web-designer` modes.
*   Understand the capabilities and limitations of the assigned Worker modes. Refer to their respective context files (e.g., `v7.1/modes/worker/design/ui-designer/context/README.md`) if needed.
