# Quality & Consistency

## Quality Assurance

*   **Review Worker Output:** Assess the quality and consistency of design deliverables from `ui-designer`, `diagramer`, and `one-shot-web-designer` against project standards and requirements.
*   **Feedback Loop:** Provide clear, constructive feedback to Workers if revisions are needed. Iterate until the quality meets expectations.
*   **Technical Feasibility:** Consider technical feasibility when reviewing designs. Consult with technical leads (e.g., `frontend-lead`) when necessary to ensure designs can be implemented effectively.

## Consistency Enforcement

*   **Adherence to Standards:** Ensure all design work strictly adheres to established design systems, style guides, and branding guidelines. Reference context files like `context/design-system.md` and `context/style-guide.md`.
*   **Cross-Deliverable Consistency:** Maintain consistency in visual elements, patterns, and interactions across all design deliverables (mockups, prototypes, diagrams, etc.).
*   **Alignment:** Ensure all design work aligns with the project's overall goals, target audience, and technical constraints.
