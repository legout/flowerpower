# 🐇 Bun Specialist - Mode Documentation

## Description

Bun is a fast, all-in-one JavaScript runtime and toolkit designed as a high-performance, drop-in replacement for Node.js, aiming to improve speed and developer experience. It integrates a runtime (using JavaScriptCore), bundler, test runner (Jest-compatible), package manager (npm/yarn compatible), and shell (`Bun.$`). Built with Zig, Bun natively supports TypeScript/JSX, implements many Node.js and Web APIs (like `fetch`, `WebSocket`), and offers optimized APIs (`Bun.serve`, `Bun.file`, `bun:ffi`, `bun:sqlite`) for performance-critical applications, scripting, and full-stack development.

This mode specializes in leveraging all aspects of the Bun toolkit.

## Core Knowledge & Capabilities

**Executive Summary:**

The official Bun documentation (primarily on `bun.sh` and the `oven-sh/bun` GitHub repository) provides comprehensive coverage of most core concepts, principles, functionalities, and APIs requested. The documentation details the runtime (JSC, native APIs like `Bun.serve`, `Bun.file`, `bun:sqlite`, `bun:ffi`), the bundler, test runner (including Jest compatibility), package manager (`npm`/`yarn` compatibility, `bun install`), shell integration (`Bun Shell`), Node.js compatibility layer, and plugin system. Information on best practices is often integrated within the API documentation and guides. Coverage of common pitfalls and advanced usage patterns is less explicit but can be inferred from API details, limitations mentioned, and GitHub issues (though relying solely on official docs is preferred). Documentation gaps exist primarily in detailed comparisons of advanced edge cases, complex plugin interactions, and exhaustive lists of Node.js compatibility nuances, which are often tracked via GitHub issues rather than static documentation pages.

**1. Introduction to Bun**

Bun is positioned as an all-in-one JavaScript runtime and toolkit designed for speed [1, 4]. It ships as a single executable (`bun`) containing the runtime, a bundler, a test runner, and a Node.js-compatible package manager [2, 4]. Key design goals include:

*   **Speed:** Fast startup and execution times, leveraging the JavaScriptCore (JSC) engine and native code written in Zig [1, 4, 6].
*   **Elegant APIs:** Providing minimal, highly-optimized APIs for common tasks [1, 35].
*   **Cohesive Developer Experience (DX):** Integrating essential tools (bundler, tester, package manager) into one executable [1, 2].
*   **Node.js Compatibility:** Aiming to be a drop-in replacement for Node.js, implementing many Node.js APIs and module resolution logic [1, 4, 17].

**2. Runtime Features**

*   **JavaScript Engine:** Bun uses JavaScriptCore (JSC), the engine developed by Apple for Safari, known for fast startup and performance [1, 4, 6]. This contrasts with Node.js and Deno, which use V8 [6, 22, 29].
*   **Native APIs (Built-in Modules & `Bun` Global):** Bun provides optimized, native APIs for server-side tasks where web standards may not exist or are insufficient [35]. It prioritizes Web-standard APIs (like `fetch`, `WebSocket`, `ReadableStream`) where possible [4, 35].
    *   **`Bun.serve` (HTTP Server):** A high-performance API for creating HTTP servers [28].
        *   Uses a `fetch`-like handler signature: `(Request) => Response | Promise<Response>` [28].
        *   Supports WebSockets with a specific `websocket` handler object (`open`, `message`, `close`, `drain`) [43].
        *   Optimized file serving using `Bun.file()` which leverages `sendfile(2)` system call for zero-copy transfers where possible [28].
        *   Bun also implements Node.js `http` and `https` modules using its internal fast HTTP infrastructure [28].
        ```typescript
        // Example: Basic Bun.serve usage
        import { serve, file } from "bun";

        serve({
          port: 3000,
          fetch(req) {
            const url = new URL(req.url);
            if (url.pathname === "/") {
              return new Response("Welcome home!");
            }
            if (url.pathname === "/file") {
              // Efficiently serve a file
              return new Response(file("./package.json"));
            }
            // Handle 404
            return new Response("Not Found", { status: 404 });
          },
          error(error: Error) {
            // Handle errors during request processing
            console.error("Server error:", error);
            return new Response("Internal Server Error", { status: 500 });
          },
        });

        console.log("Listening on http://localhost:3000");
        ```
    *   **`Bun.file` (File I/O):** Represents a file on the filesystem lazily. Used for efficient reading and writing [2, 35].
        *   Provides methods like `.text()`, `.json()`, `.arrayBuffer()`, `.stream()` for reading content [2].
        *   Used with `Bun.write(destination, Bun.file(source))` for optimized file copying [2].
        *   Can be directly returned in `Bun.serve` responses for optimized streaming [28].
        ```typescript
        // Example: Reading a file with Bun.file
        const pkgFile = Bun.file("./package.json");

        // Read as text
        const textContent = await pkgFile.text();
        console.log("Package content (text):", textContent.substring(0, 100) + "...");

        // Read as JSON
        const jsonContent = await pkgFile.json();
        console.log("Package name (JSON):", jsonContent.name);

        // Get file size
        console.log("File size:", pkgFile.size, "bytes");

        // Check existence
        const exists = await pkgFile.exists();
        console.log("File exists:", exists);
        ```
    *   **`bun:ffi` (Foreign Function Interface):** Allows calling native code (C/C++/Zig/Rust etc.) directly from JavaScript/TypeScript [2, 15].
        *   Documentation notes this is an advanced and experimental API [40].
        *   Requires defining the symbols (functions) and their signatures (arguments and return types) from a dynamic library (`.dylib`, `.so`, `.dll`).
        ```typescript
        // Example: Basic FFI usage (Conceptual - requires a compiled native library)
        import { dlopen, FFIType, suffix } from "bun:ffi";

        // Assume libmylib.{dylib|so|dll} exists and exports 'add' function
        const libraryPath = `libmylib.${suffix}`;

        try {
          const { symbols } = dlopen(
            libraryPath,
            {
              add: {
                args: [FFIType.i32, FFIType.i32], // Takes two 32-bit integers
                returns: FFIType.i32,          // Returns a 32-bit integer
              },
            }
          );

          const result = symbols.add(5, 3);
          console.log(`FFI Result: 5 + 3 = ${result}`); // Output: FFI Result: 5 + 3 = 8

        } catch (e) {
          console.error(`Failed to load or use FFI library at ${libraryPath}:`, e);
          console.error("Ensure the library is compiled and accessible.");
        }
        ```
    *   **`bun:sqlite` (SQLite Driver):** A built-in, high-performance SQLite3 driver with a synchronous API inspired by `better-sqlite3` [15, 37].
        *   Supports transactions, prepared statements (cached via `.query()`, non-cached via `.prepare()`), named/positional parameters [37, 42].
        *   Handles data type conversions (e.g., `BLOB` to `Uint8Array`) [37].
        *   Supports `bigint` for large integers (requires `safeIntegers: true` option for full handling) [37].
        *   Allows database serialization/deserialization [37].
        ```typescript
        // Example: Basic bun:sqlite usage
        import { Database } from "bun:sqlite";

        // Open (or create) a database file
        const db = new Database("mydb.sqlite", { create: true });

        try {
          // Run DDL (Data Definition Language)
          db.run("CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS users (id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT, name TEXT)");

          // Prepare an INSERT statement (cached)
          const insertStmt = db.query("INSERT INTO users (name) VALUES (?) RETURNING id");

          // Execute the statement
          const result1 = insertStmt.get("Alice"); // .get() for single row
          console.log("Inserted Alice with ID:", result1.id);
          const result2 = insertStmt.get("Bob");
          console.log("Inserted Bob with ID:", result2.id);

          // Prepare a SELECT statement (cached)
          const selectStmt = db.query("SELECT id, name FROM users WHERE name = ?");

          // Query for a user
          const user = selectStmt.get("Alice"); // .get() returns the first matching row as an object
          console.log("Found user:", user);

          // Query for all users
          const allUsers = db.query("SELECT id, name FROM users").all(); // .all() returns all rows as an array of objects
          console.log("All users:", allUsers);

        } catch (e) {
          console.error("SQLite operation failed:", e);
        } finally {
          // Close the database connection
          db.close();
          console.log("Database closed.");
        }
        ```
*   **TypeScript & JSX Support:** Bun has a built-in transpiler, allowing direct execution of `.ts`, `.tsx`, and `.jsx` files without pre-compilation steps [4, 23, 29].

**3. Bundler (`Bun.build`)**

Bun includes a fast, native bundler designed for performance [4, 24, 29].

*   **Features:** Supports transpiling TS/JS/JSX, minification, tree-shaking (though some sources note limitations [29]), CSS bundling (including CSS Modules, transpiling modern features, vendor prefixing via LightningCSS port) [27], loaders for different file types, and plugins [2, 26, 27].
*   **Performance:** Often benchmarked as significantly faster than tools like Webpack, Rollup, and Parcel [23, 24].
*   **API:** Accessed via `Bun.build({ entrypoints: [...], outdir: '...', ... })` [24, 26].
*   **Plugins:** Uses the same plugin API as the runtime to extend functionality (e.g., custom loaders, transformations) [25, 26].

```typescript
// Example: Basic Bundling with Bun.build
import { build } from "bun";

console.log("Starting build...");

try {
  const result = await build({
    entrypoints: ["./src/index.ts"], // Your main entry file(s)
    outdir: "./dist",              // Output directory
    target: "browser",             // Target environment ('browser', 'bun', 'node')
    format: "esm",                 // Output format ('esm', 'cjs', 'iife')
    minify: true,                  // Enable minification
    sourcemap: "external",         // Generate sourcemaps
    // splitting: true,            // Enable code splitting (if needed)
    // plugins: [myPlugin],        // Add bundler plugins if any
  });

  if (result.success) {
    console.log("Build successful!");
    result.outputs.forEach(output => {
      console.log(` - ${output.path} (${(output.size / 1024).toFixed(2)} KB)`);
    });
  } else {
    console.error("Build failed:");
    result.logs.forEach(log => console.error(log));
  }
} catch (e) {
  console.error("Error during build process:", e);
}
```

**4. Test Runner (`bun test`)**

Bun features a built-in test runner designed for speed and Jest compatibility [2, 10, 18].

*   **Jest Compatibility:** Aims for high compatibility with Jest's API (`describe`, `it`, `test`, `expect`, matchers, lifecycle hooks, mocking) [8, 10, 12]. Many Jest test suites can run with `bun test` without changes [8]. Bun internally rewrites imports from `@jest/globals` and injects globals like Jest [8]. Full compatibility is tracked via GitHub issues, with some specific matchers or features potentially missing [8, 10, 12].
*   **Performance:** Significantly faster than Jest and other runners due to integration with the Bun runtime [12, 19, 23].
*   **Features:** Supports TypeScript/JSX out-of-the-box, snapshot testing, watch mode, code coverage (`--coverage`), UI/DOM testing (compatible with libraries like Testing Library, HappyDOM) [10, 18].
*   **Execution:** Finds files matching patterns like `*.test.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}` or `*.spec.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}` [10].

```typescript
// Example: Basic test file (e.g., utils.test.ts)
import { test, expect, describe } from "bun:test"; // Or rely on globals

// Function to test (in utils.ts or similar)
const add = (a: number, b: number): number => a + b;

describe("add function", () => {
  test("should add two positive numbers", () => {
    expect(add(2, 3)).toBe(5);
  });

  test("should add a positive and a negative number", () => {
    expect(add(5, -2)).toBe(3);
  });

  // Example of a failing test
  // test("this will fail", () => {
  //   expect(add(1, 1)).toBe(3);
  // });
});

// Run with: bun test
```

**5. Package Manager (`bun install`, `bun add`, `bun remove`)**

Bun includes a very fast, npm-compatible package manager [1, 7, 17].

*   **Compatibility:** Works with `package.json`, installs into `node_modules`, respects `.npmrc`, and can read `package-lock.json` for migration [1, 7, 13]. It can be used as a standalone package manager even without using the Bun runtime [7, 11]. Commands (`install`, `add`, `remove`) are familiar to npm/yarn/pnpm users [1, 7].
*   **Performance:** Achieves speed through optimized system calls, a global cache (downloads each package version once), and parallel installation [1, 7, 13, 17]. Benchmarks claim significant speedups over npm, yarn, and pnpm [1, 7].
*   **Lockfile:** Uses a binary lockfile (`bun.lockb`) for faster parsing and ensuring deterministic installs [7]. A text-based lockfile format was introduced later for better SCM integration [33].
*   **Workspaces:** Supports monorepo workspaces defined in `package.json` out of the box [1, 7].
*   **Security:** Does not run `postinstall` scripts by default, requiring explicit opt-in via `trustedDependencies` in `package.json` for non-allowlisted packages [1, 7].
*   **Lifecycle Scripts:** Executes `package.json` scripts (`preinstall`, `postinstall`, etc.) [2].

**Comparison Table: Package Manager Commands**

| Action                 | Bun Command        | npm Command        | yarn Command       | pnpm Command       |

# 🐇 Bun Specialist - Mode Documentation

## Description

Bun is a fast, all-in-one JavaScript runtime and toolkit designed as a high-performance, drop-in replacement for Node.js, aiming to improve speed and developer experience. It integrates a runtime (using JavaScriptCore), bundler, test runner (Jest-compatible), package manager (npm/yarn compatible), and shell (`Bun.$`). Built with Zig, Bun natively supports TypeScript/JSX, implements many Node.js and Web APIs (like `fetch`, `WebSocket`), and offers optimized APIs (`Bun.serve`, `Bun.file`, `bun:ffi`, `bun:sqlite`) for performance-critical applications, scripting, and full-stack development.

This mode specializes in leveraging all aspects of the Bun toolkit.

## Core Knowledge & Capabilities

 from `bun` and use template literals for commands.
*   **Features:** Handles piping, redirection, environment variables, and common shell operations within JS/TS syntax [3]. Aims to replace tools like `cross-env`, `rimraf`, `node-which` [1].

  console.error("Exit code:", error.exitCode);
}
```

**7. Node.js Compatibility Layer**

A core goal of Bun is to be a drop-in replacement for Node.js [1, 4, 17].

*   **Implementation:** Bun natively implements many Node.js APIs (e.g., `fs`, `path`, `http`, `https`, `buffer`, `process`, `events`, `stream`, `assert`, `os`, `url`, `http2`, `dgram`, `zlib`) and Node's module resolution algorithm [1, 4, 28, 30, 32].
*   **Goal:** Run most existing Node.js applications and npm packages without modification [4, 17].
*   **Status:** Compatibility is actively being improved, with Bun's team running parts of the official Node.js test suite to measure progress [32]. However, 100% compatibility is not yet achieved, and some APIs or specific behaviors might be missing or differ [3, 22, 34]. Frameworks relying on specific Node.js internals might encounter issues [3].
*   **Usage:** Use Node.js built-ins directly (e.g., `import fs from 'fs'`) or with the `node:` prefix (e.g., `import path from 'node:path'`) [4].

**8. Plugin System**

Bun provides a universal plugin API to extend both the runtime and the bundler [25, 26].

*   **Purpose:** Intercept imports, add support for custom file types (e.g., `.yaml`, `.scss`), perform custom transformations, or implement framework-level features [25, 26].
*   **Structure:** A plugin is an object with a `name` and a `setup` function. The `setup` function receives a `build` object with methods like `onResolve` (to customize module resolution) and `onLoad` (to define how files are loaded and transformed) [25, 26].
*   **Registration:** Plugins are registered using `Bun.plugin()` for the runtime or passed in the `plugins` array to `Bun.build()` for the bundler [25, 26]. Runtime plugins often need to be preloaded via `bunfig.toml` [25].
*   **Loaders:** `onLoad` callbacks typically return code that one of Bun's built-in loaders (`js`, `jsx`, `ts`, `tsx`, `css`, `json`, `toml`, etc.) can process [25, 26].
*   **Native Plugins:** An experimental C API exists for creating high-performance native plugins (e.g., in Rust via NAPI) that can run in parallel within the bundler [40].

```typescript
// Example: Simple Runtime Plugin (e.g., yaml-plugin.ts)
import { plugin, type BunPlugin } from "bun";
import { load } from "js-yaml"; // Assuming 'js-yaml' is installed

const yamlPlugin: BunPlugin = {
  name: "YAML Loader",
  async setup(build) {
    // Intercept imports ending in .yaml or .yml
    build.onLoad({ filter: /\.(yaml|yml)$/ }, async (args) => {
      // Read the file content
      const text = await Bun.file(args.path).text();
      // Parse YAML content
      const exports = load(text);

      // Return as JSON module content
      return {
        contents: JSON.stringify(exports),
        loader: "json", // Use Bun's built-in JSON loader for the result

```

**9. Common Pitfalls & Advanced Usage Patterns**

While official documentation doesn't have a dedicated "Pitfalls" section, some can be inferred or are mentioned contextually:

*   **Node.js Compatibility Gaps:** Relying on obscure or very new Node.js APIs might lead to errors or unexpected behavior. Check compatibility lists or GitHub issues if problems arise [3, 34].
*   **Plugin Loading:** Runtime plugins must be loaded *before* the application code that depends on them, typically using the `preload` option in `bunfig.toml` [25].
*   **FFI Complexity:** Using `bun:ffi` requires understanding C ABI, memory management, and potential platform differences. It's marked as experimental/advanced [40].
*   **`bun:sqlite` Synchronous Nature:** The core `bun:sqlite` API is synchronous. While fast, heavy synchronous operations could potentially block the event loop in highly concurrent servers if not managed carefully (e.g., using workers for complex queries, though the driver itself is highly optimized) [37]. Drizzle ORM provides async wrappers [38].
*   **Binary Lockfile (`bun.lockb`):** While fast, the binary format can cause issues with version control diffs/merges. Bun later introduced an optional text-based lockfile format to address this [33].
*   **`postinstall` Scripts Disabled:** Packages relying on `postinstall` scripts for setup might not work correctly unless explicitly trusted via `trustedDependencies` [1, 7].
*   **Experimental Features:** Some APIs or features might be experimental and subject to change.
*   **Debugging:** Debugging support, especially for complex scenarios or across FFI boundaries, might be less mature than Node.js initially, though VS Code extensions and web debuggers exist [2, 19].
*   **Performance Edge Cases:** While generally fast, specific workloads might not see the same dramatic speedups observed in benchmarks, especially if the bottleneck is application logic rather than runtime overhead [34]. JSC vs V8 differences might also play a role in pure JS computation [34].

**Advanced Patterns (Inferred from APIs):**

*   **Zero-Copy File Serving:** Using `return new Response(Bun.file(...))` in `Bun.serve` for maximum performance [28].
*   **Optimized File Copying:** Using `Bun.write(dest, Bun.file(src))` [2].
*   **WebSocket Pub/Sub:** Leveraging the built-in pub/sub mechanism in `Bun.serve` for efficient WebSocket broadcasting [43].
*   **Native Plugins:** For performance-critical bundler extensions [40].
*   **Macros:** Using bundler plugins to implement compile-time code generation/transformation (macros) [26].
*   **Standalone Executables:** Bundling applications into single-file executables using `bun build --compile` [2].

**10. Boundary of Documentation**

*   **Documented:** Core APIs (`Bun.serve`, `Bun.file`, `bun:sqlite`, `bun:ffi`, `Bun Shell`, Web APIs), bundler (`Bun.build`), test runner (`bun test`), package manager (`bun install`), plugin basics, Node.js compatibility goals and major implemented modules. Basic usage, configuration options, and performance goals are well-covered.
*   **Less Documented / Gaps:**
    *   Exhaustive, up-to-the-minute Node.js compatibility status for *all* edge cases and specific API behaviors (often best tracked via GitHub issues/tests).
    *   Complex interactions between multiple advanced features (e.g., intricate plugin chains affecting runtime behavior).
    *   Detailed performance characteristics under *all possible* workloads (benchmarks provide specific scenarios).
    *   In-depth guides on debugging complex issues, especially involving native code or plugins.
    *   Explicit "Best Practices" guides beyond API usage examples (though good practices are often demonstrated).
    *   Long-term stability and production-readiness nuances compared to the highly mature Node.js ecosystem (though Bun is used in production [1, 22]).

## Responsibilities

*   **Runtime Implementation:** Build applications and scripts utilizing Bun's core runtime features and optimized APIs (`Bun.serve`, `Bun.file`, `bun:ffi`, `bun:sqlite`, Web APIs).
*   **Package Management:** Manage project dependencies efficiently using `bun install`, `bun add`, `bun remove`, understanding the `bun.lockb` lockfile.
*   **Testing:** Write and execute tests using Bun's Jest-compatible test runner (`bun test`).
*   **Bundling:** Configure and use Bun to bundle JavaScript/TypeScript code for various targets.
*   **Scripting:** Utilize Bun Shell (`Bun.$`) for cross-platform scripting tasks.
*   **Migration:** Assist in migrating existing Node.js projects to Bun, addressing compatibility issues and optimizing for performance.
*   **Configuration:** Manage Bun project settings via `bunfig.toml`.
*   **Best Practices:** Advise on optimal ways to use Bun for different scenarios (e.g., backend servers, CLI tools, frontend bundling).

## Setup & Usage

To use Bun in an existing Node.js project, navigate to the project directory containing `package.json` and run `bun install`. This uses Bun's fast package manager to install dependencies into `node_modules` and creates a `bun.lockb` lockfile.

For new projects, `bun init` can scaffold a basic structure.

If using TypeScript, update `tsconfig.json` to replace `@types/node` with `bun-types` and ensure `"types": ["bun-types"]` is set in `compilerOptions`.

Execute project scripts defined in `package.json` via `bun run <script_name>`.

**Usage Examples:**

**Example 1: Install Dependencies**
```prompt
Use Bun to install the dependencies for the project in the current directory.
```

**Example 2: Run Tests**
```prompt
Execute the test suite using Bun's test runner.
```

**Example 3: Create a simple HTTP server**
```prompt
Write a basic HTTP server using `Bun.serve` in `server.ts` that responds with "Hello, Bun!".
```

## Limitations

*   While Bun aims for Node.js compatibility, subtle differences may exist. Deep Node.js C++ addon issues might require escalation.
*   Focuses on Bun itself; complex issues within specific frontend frameworks (React, Vue, etc.) unrelated to Bun's bundling or runtime aspects should be delegated.
*   Does not manage infrastructure deployment (delegate to DevOps/Infra specialists).

## Rationale / Design Decisions

*   Bun's speed and integrated tooling offer significant potential for improving developer experience and application performance.
*   A dedicated specialist is needed to effectively leverage Bun's unique features, manage migrations, and ensure best practices are followed.
*   Separating Bun expertise allows other specialists (e.g., React) to focus on their core domain while collaborating with the Bun specialist for runtime/tooling aspects.
