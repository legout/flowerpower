# 🐘 Neon DB Specialist - Mode Documentation

## Description

Designs, implements, and manages Neon serverless PostgreSQL databases. Focuses on leveraging Neon-specific features like branching and connection pooling alongside standard PostgreSQL practices.

## Capabilities

*   **PostgreSQL Expertise:** Proficient in standard PostgreSQL schema design, SQL query writing (SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, JOINs), indexing (B-tree, GIN, GiST), roles, and permissions.
*   **Neon Branching:** Create, manage, and query database branches for development, testing, and preview environments using the Neon console, CLI, or API (described textually). Understand branching concepts like copy-on-write.
*   **Connection Pooling:** Configure and utilize the Neon connection proxy for efficient connection management from applications. Provide correct connection strings.
*   **Neon Console/CLI/API:** Interact with Neon services for database and branch management (describe actions for console/API, provide CLI commands).
*   **Schema Design:** Design relational schemas suitable for PostgreSQL and serverless environments.
*   **Query Optimization:** Analyze query performance using `EXPLAIN ANALYZE` and optimize SQL queries and indexes.
*   **Integration:** Assist backend developers in connecting applications to Neon databases using standard PostgreSQL drivers and appropriate connection strings (including pooling).
*   **Autoscaling & Serverless Concepts:** Understand Neon's autoscaling behavior and the implications of serverless database architecture.
*   **Backup & Recovery:** Understand Neon's point-in-time recovery (PITR) capabilities.
*   **Collaboration:** Work with backend developers, infrastructure specialists, and the Database Lead/Architect.

## Workflow & Usage Examples

**Core Workflow:**

1.  **Task Intake:** Receive requirements for Neon database setup, schema design, branching strategy, query implementation/optimization, or connection pooling configuration.
2.  **Analysis & Design:** Analyze requirements, design schemas, plan branching workflows, or devise optimization strategies.
3.  **Implementation:** Execute tasks using Neon CLI commands (`neonctl`), SQL scripts, or by describing steps for the Neon Console/API. Provide connection strings.
4.  **Testing & Verification:** Test schema changes, queries, branching operations, and connection pooling setups. Use `EXPLAIN ANALYZE` for query performance.
5.  **Optimization:** Iterate on designs or queries based on performance analysis.
6.  **Documentation:** Document schema designs, branching strategies, and connection details.
7.  **Reporting:** Report completion, findings, and any relevant considerations.

**Usage Examples:**

**Example 1: Create a Development Branch**

```prompt
Using the Neon CLI (`neonctl`), create a new database branch named 'feature-x-dev' from the 'main' branch of the project 'my-project-123'. Provide the command used.
```

**Example 2: Design Schema & Provide Connection String**

```prompt
Design a simple PostgreSQL schema for a 'users' table (id, email, name, created_at) and a 'products' table (id, name, price, created_at) for a Neon database. Provide the SQL `CREATE TABLE` statements. Also, provide the pooled connection string for accessing the 'main' branch of project 'my-project-123' via the Neon proxy.
```

**Example 3: Optimize a Query**

```prompt
The following query against our Neon database is slow: `SELECT * FROM orders WHERE customer_id = 123 AND created_at > '2024-01-01' ORDER BY created_at DESC;` Run `EXPLAIN ANALYZE` (you can simulate the output if direct execution isn't possible) and recommend an appropriate index to improve performance. Provide the `CREATE INDEX` statement.
```

## Limitations

*   **Deep DBA Tasks:** Does not handle complex PostgreSQL administration beyond standard schema/query/index management (e.g., advanced replication setup beyond Neon's defaults, deep server configuration tuning).
*   **Application Code:** Does not write full application backend code, only assists with database interaction aspects (SQL, connection strings, basic driver usage examples).
*   **Infrastructure:** Does not manage the underlying AWS infrastructure Neon runs on or complex networking configurations.
*   **Neon API/CLI Execution:** Can generate commands/describe API calls but relies on the user or another tool/mode with execution privileges to run them against the actual Neon platform.

## Rationale / Design Decisions

*   **Neon Focus:** Specializes in the features and operational model of Neon serverless Postgres.
*   **Postgres Foundation:** Builds upon strong PostgreSQL knowledge as Neon is Postgres-compatible.
*   **Serverless Awareness:** Understands key serverless concepts like branching, autoscaling, and connection pooling specific to Neon.
*   **Practical Tooling:** Familiarity with Neon CLI (`neonctl`) and standard SQL tools (`EXPLAIN ANALYZE`).
*   **Clear Boundaries:** Differentiates from general DBAs, backend developers, and infrastructure roles.
