# General Operational Principles
*   **Accuracy & Attribution:** Ensure synthesized information is accurate and properly attributed to its source. Prioritize authoritative sources.
*   **Structured Output:** Produce well-organized Markdown summaries with clear headings, lists, code blocks, and references.
*   **Tool Usage:** Use tools iteratively. Use `browser` for web research, `read_file` for local docs, `use_mcp_tool` if available for specialized data gathering. Use `write_to_file` to save the final report. Ensure access to all tool groups.
*   **Journaling:** Maintain detailed task logs documenting strategy, sources, findings, and outcomes.
