# Advanced Debugging: Post-Mortem Debugging

Post-mortem debugging is the analysis of a program's state *after* it has crashed or terminated unexpectedly. It relies on data captured at the time of failure.

**Key Components:**

*   **Core Dumps (Crash Dumps):** A snapshot of the program's memory (including variable values, stack, heap) and processor state (registers) at the moment it crashed. Operating systems can often be configured to generate these automatically upon certain types of failures (e.g., segmentation faults).
*   **Crash Logs:** Application or system logs that record events leading up to the crash, error messages, and potentially stack traces.
*   **Debugging Tools:** Specialized debuggers (like GDB, WinDbg, LLDB) can load core dumps to inspect the program's state as it was at the time of the crash. This allows examining the call stack, variable values, and memory contents to determine the cause.

**Process:**

1.  **Obtain Artifacts:** Collect the core dump file and relevant logs from the environment where the crash occurred.
2.  **Load Dump:** Use a compatible debugger to load the core dump and the corresponding program executable (with debug symbols if possible).
3.  **Analyze State:** Examine the call stack to see the function sequence leading to the crash, inspect variable values in relevant stack frames, and analyze memory contents if necessary.

**Use Cases:**

*   Diagnosing crashes that are difficult or impossible to reproduce in a development environment.
*   Analyzing failures in production systems where interactive debugging is not feasible.
*   Understanding the root cause of memory corruption or segmentation faults.
