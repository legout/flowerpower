# Advanced Debugging: Dynamic Analysis

Dynamic analysis involves examining a program's behavior *during execution*. Unlike static analysis (which inspects code without running it), dynamic analysis provides insights into runtime state, interactions, and resource usage.

**Key Aspects:**

*   **Instrumentation:** Modifying the code (often automatically at compile-time or runtime) to insert probes or hooks that collect data during execution (e.g., function entry/exit times, variable values, memory allocations).
*   **Tracing:** Recording the sequence of events or function calls as the program runs. This helps understand complex execution paths and interactions between components.
*   **Profiling:** A specific type of dynamic analysis focused on measuring performance characteristics like execution time, memory usage, CPU utilization, and I/O operations (See `performance_profiling.md`).
*   **Debugging Tools:** Standard debuggers are a form of dynamic analysis tool, allowing inspection and control during runtime.
*   **Specialized Tools:** Tools like Valgrind (memory errors, profiling), DTrace (system-level tracing), Wireshark (network traffic analysis), and various Application Performance Monitoring (APM) systems employ dynamic analysis.

**Use Cases:**

*   Understanding complex runtime behavior not obvious from static code.
*   Diagnosing performance bottlenecks.
*   Detecting memory leaks and errors.
*   Analyzing interactions in concurrent or distributed systems.
