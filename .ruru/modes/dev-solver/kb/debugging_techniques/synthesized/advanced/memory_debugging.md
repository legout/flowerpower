# Advanced Debugging: Memory Debugging

Memory debugging specifically targets errors related to dynamic memory allocation and usage, common in languages like C and C++.

**Common Memory Errors:**

*   **Memory Leaks:** Allocated memory is no longer needed but is not released (freed), leading to gradual exhaustion of available memory.
*   **Buffer Overflows/Overruns:** Writing data beyond the allocated boundaries of a buffer, potentially corrupting adjacent memory or causing crashes.
*   **Use-After-Free:** Accessing memory after it has been deallocated. The memory might have been reused, leading to unpredictable behavior or crashes.
*   **Dangling Pointers:** Pointers that refer to memory locations that are no longer valid (e.g., after `free` or pointing to a stack variable that went out of scope).
*   **Uninitialized Reads:** Reading from memory that hasn't been assigned a defined value.
*   **Double Free:** Attempting to free the same memory block twice.

**Techniques and Tools:**

*   **Memory Checkers/Debuggers:** Tools that instrument memory allocations and accesses to detect errors at runtime.
    *   **Valgrind (Memcheck tool):** A widely used dynamic analysis tool for Linux that detects leaks, invalid reads/writes, use-after-free, and more.
    *   **AddressSanitizer (ASan):** A fast memory error detector integrated into compilers (GCC, Clang, MSVC). It detects buffer overflows, use-after-free, and similar issues with relatively low performance overhead.
    *   **LeakSanitizer (LSan):** Often used with ASan, specifically detects memory leaks.
    *   **Memory Profilers:** Tools (sometimes part of IDEs or standalone like Heaptrack) that track allocations and help identify sources of leaks or excessive memory usage.
*   **Code Review:** Carefully inspecting code related to memory allocation (`malloc`, `calloc`, `realloc`, `free`, `new`, `delete`), pointer arithmetic, and buffer handling.
*   **Static Analysis:** Some static analyzers can detect potential memory errors (e.g., potential null pointer dereferences, buffer size mismatches).

**Use Cases:**

*   Essential for developing robust applications in languages with manual memory management.
*   Diagnosing crashes caused by memory corruption.
*   Finding and fixing memory leaks that degrade performance or cause eventual failure.
