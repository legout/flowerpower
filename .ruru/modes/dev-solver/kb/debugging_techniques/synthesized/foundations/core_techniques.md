# Core Debugging Techniques

These foundational techniques are essential for everyday software development:

1.  **Using a Debugger:** Interactive tools allowing step-by-step execution (step over, into, out), setting breakpoints to pause execution, inspecting variable values, and examining the call stack to understand program flow and state.
2.  **Print Debugging / Logging:** Inserting statements (`print`, `console.log`) to output variable values or trace messages at runtime. Useful for quick checks but less structured than dedicated logging frameworks.
3.  **Rubber Duck Debugging:** Explaining the code's logic and expected behavior aloud (to a person or object) to force clearer thinking and often reveal assumptions or errors.
4.  **Reproducing the Bug:** Systematically identifying the exact steps, inputs, and conditions to trigger a bug reliably. Essential for isolating the issue and verifying the fix.
5.  **Version Control System (VCS) Analysis:** Using tools like `git bisect` or manually reviewing commit history to identify the specific change that introduced a regression.
6.  **Static Analysis Tools:** Using linters (e.g., ESLint, Pylint) and code analyzers (e.g., SonarQube) to automatically detect potential errors, style issues, and anti-patterns without running the code.
7.  **Testing (Unit & Integration):** Writing and running automated tests helps pinpoint failures to specific code units or component interactions. Failing tests provide a starting point for debugging.
