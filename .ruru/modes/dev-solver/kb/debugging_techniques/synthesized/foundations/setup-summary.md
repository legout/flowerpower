# Debugging Setup Summary

Setting up for debugging primarily involves configuring the development environment and tools specific to the programming language, framework, and runtime being used. 

*   **Integrated Development Environments (IDEs):** Modern IDEs (e.g., VS Code, Visual Studio, IntelliJ IDEA, PyCharm) often have built-in debugging support. Setup typically involves:
    *   Ensuring the correct language extensions/plugins are installed.
    *   Configuring launch profiles (`launch.json` in VS Code) to specify how to start the application in debug mode (e.g., entry point, arguments, environment variables).
    *   Learning the IDE's interface for setting breakpoints, stepping through code, inspecting variables, and viewing the call stack.
*   **Language/Platform Specific Tools:** Some languages or platforms require separate debugger installations or specific compilation flags (e.g., compiling C++ with `-g` for debug symbols).
*   **Logging Frameworks:** While not debuggers, setting up a logging framework (like Log4j, Serilog, Python's `logging`) is crucial for effective tracing, especially in production or complex systems.

Basic setup often relies heavily on IDE features, while advanced debugging (e.g., memory profiling, reverse debugging) may require specialized tools and more complex configuration.
