# Debugging Techniques: General Summary

Debugging is the critical process of identifying, analyzing, and resolving defects (bugs) in software to ensure correct operation. It encompasses a wide range of techniques applicable throughout the development lifecycle. Foundational methods include using interactive debuggers for step-by-step execution analysis, employing print statements or logging for tracing program flow and variable states, and explaining the code logic (Rubber Duck Debugging) to uncover flawed reasoning. More systematic approaches involve reliably reproducing bugs, analyzing version control history (e.g., `git bisect`) to pinpoint regressions, utilizing static analysis tools to catch potential issues pre-execution, and leveraging unit/integration tests to isolate failures. Advanced techniques address complex scenarios like dynamic analysis during runtime, post-mortem analysis of crashes, reverse debugging to step backward, memory debugging for leaks and corruption, concurrency debugging for parallel execution issues, distributed systems debugging across multiple services, and performance profiling to identify bottlenecks.
