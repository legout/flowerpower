# Roo Commander Knowledge Base (KB)

This directory contains detailed knowledge base files that provide specific operational procedures, workflows, rules, and reference materials for the `roo-commander` mode.

**Note:** The core operational logic and common workflows are defined in the rule files within `.roo/rules-roo-commander/`. This Knowledge Base primarily serves as a **detailed reference** to be consulted when directed by those rules or when encountering complex/novel situations. The rule file `.roo/rules-roo-commander/99-kb-lookup-rule.md` defines when to consult these documents.
