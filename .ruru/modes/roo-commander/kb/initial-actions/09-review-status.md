# KB: Initial Action - Review Project Status / Manage Tasks

## 1. Objective ðŸŽ¯
*   To understand which aspect of the project the user wants to review the status of or manage tasks for, and then delegate this to the appropriate agent: `manager-project` if the project utilizes MDTM, or `agent-context-resolver` for a general status summary based on available artifacts.

## 2. Roles & Responsibilities ðŸ‘¤
*   **Coordinator (Roo Commander):** Gathers user's focus area, determines if MDTM is used, delegates to the appropriate mode, reports initiation.
*   **User:** Specifies the area of interest for status review or task management.
*   **Delegate (`manager-project`):** Handles MDTM-based task viewing, updating, and status reporting.
*   **Delegate (`agent-context-resolver`):** Provides a general status summary based on reading project artifacts like logs, plans, and decisions.

## 3. Procedure Steps ðŸªœ

*   **Step 1: Identify Focus Area (Coordinator Task)**
    *   **Description:** Ask the user what specific feature, epic, task ID, or general area they want to review or manage.
    *   **Inputs:** User selected "ðŸ“Š Review project status / Manage tasks (MDTM)".
    *   **Tool:** `ask_followup_question`
    *   **Procedure:**
        1.  Present the prompt:
            ```xml
             <ask_followup_question>
              <question>Okay, let's look at the project status or manage some tasks. What specific area are you interested in?
              (e.g., 'Overall project status', 'Status of the Authentication feature', 'Details for task TASK-FEAT-123', 'Tasks assigned to dev-react')
              </question>
              <follow_up>
                <suggest>Show overall project status summary</suggest>
                <suggest>Cancel status review</suggest>
              </follow_up>
             </ask_followup_question>
            ```
        2.  Await user response. Store it as `[Focus Area]`.
    *   **Outputs:** `[Focus Area]` specified by the user.
    *   **Error Handling:** If the user cancels, report "Okay, cancelling status review. What would you like to do instead?" using `ask_followup_question` and re-present the initial 16 options. **Stop this workflow.** If the focus is unclear, prompt again for specifics.

*   **Step 2: Determine Workflow (Coordinator Task)**
    *   **Description:** Check if the project seems to be using the MDTM system (i.e., if the `.ruru/tasks/` directory exists and contains relevant files).
    *   **Inputs:** `[Focus Area]`.
    *   **Tool:** `list_files`
    *   **Procedure:**
        1.  Use `list_files` to check for the existence and content of the `.ruru/tasks/` directory.
        2.  Based on the presence of `.ruru/tasks/` and task files (`TASK-...md`), determine if MDTM is likely the appropriate system for the user's `[Focus Area]`.
            *   If the user asked for specific task management ("manage tasks", "update task status", "view tasks for X") AND MDTM files exist -> **Use MDTM Path (Step 3A)**.
            *   If the user asked for a general status summary OR MDTM files do *not* seem relevant/present -> **Use Context Resolver Path (Step 3B)**.
    *   **Outputs:** Decision on which path to follow (MDTM or Context Resolver).

*   **Step 3A: Delegate to Project Manager (Coordinator delegates to `manager-project`)**
    *   **Description:** Hand off the MDTM-related task management or status review to the `manager-project`.
    *   **Inputs:** `[Focus Area]`.
    *   **Tool:** `new_task`
    *   **Procedure:**
        1.  Generate a Task ID for `manager-project` (e.g., `TASK-PM-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS`).
        2.  Log the delegation in the Coordinator's log (Rule `08`).
        3.  Formulate the delegation message:
            ```xml
            <new_task>
              <mode>manager-project</mode>
              <message>
              ðŸ“Š MDTM Status/Management Request: The user wants to review status or manage tasks related to: "[Focus Area]".
              Please interact with the user to fulfill their request using the MDTM files in `.ruru/tasks/`. You can list tasks, show details, update status (based on user input), etc.
              Your Task ID: [Generated TASK-PM-... ID].
              Coordinator Task ID: [Coordinator's Task ID].
              </message>
            </new_task>
            ```
        4.  Proceed to Step 4.
    *   **Outputs:** Task delegated to `manager-project`.
    *   **Error Handling:** If `new_task` fails, log the error, report "Failed to delegate to Project Manager due to an error." to the user via `attempt_completion`, and stop.

*   **Step 3B: Delegate to Context Resolver (Coordinator delegates to `agent-context-resolver`)**
    *   **Description:** Request a general status summary based on project artifacts.
    *   **Inputs:** `[Focus Area]`.
    *   **Tool:** `new_task`
    *   **Procedure:**
        1.  Generate a Task ID for `agent-context-resolver` (e.g., `TASK-RESOLVE-...`).
        2.  Log the delegation in the Coordinator's log (Rule `08`).
        3.  Formulate the delegation message:
            ```xml
            <new_task>
              <mode>agent-context-resolver</mode>
              <message>
              ðŸ“Š Project Status Request: The user wants a status summary for: "[Focus Area]".
              Please read relevant files in `.ruru/tasks/`, `.ruru/planning/`, `.ruru/decisions/` and provide a concise summary of the current status, recent activity, and any known blockers related to the focus area. Cite your sources.
              Your Task ID: [Generated TASK-RESOLVE-... ID].
              Coordinator Task ID: [Coordinator's Task ID].
              </message>
            </new_task>
            ```
        4.  Proceed to Step 4.
    *   **Outputs:** Task delegated to `agent-context-resolver`.
    *   **Error Handling:** If `new_task` fails, log the error, report "Failed to delegate to Context Resolver due to an error." to the user via `attempt_completion`, and stop.

*   **Step 4: Inform User & Conclude Initial Action (Coordinator Task)**
    *   **Description:** Inform the user that the request has been assigned.
    *   **Inputs:** Successful delegation in Step 3A or 3B.
    *   **Tool:** `attempt_completion`
    *   **Procedure:**
        1.  Determine the delegate mode (`manager-project` or `agent-context-resolver`).
        2.  Send a completion message: "Okay, I've asked the `{Delegate Mode Name}` (`{Delegate Mode Slug}`) to handle your request regarding '[Focus Area]'. Please follow their prompts or await their summary."
    *   **Outputs:** User is informed, control passed to the delegate mode.
    *   **Error Handling:** N/A.

## 4. Postconditions âœ…
*   The user's area of focus for status review/task management has been identified.
*   The task has been delegated to the appropriate mode (`manager-project` or `agent-context-resolver`) based on the applicability of MDTM.
*   The user has been informed that the process is starting.
*   The Coordinator's responsibility for *this specific initial action* is complete.

## 5. Rationale / Notes ðŸ¤”
*   This workflow distinguishes between structured task management (MDTM) and general status reporting.
*   It leverages `manager-project` for interacting with the MDTM system if it's in use.
*   It uses `agent-context-resolver` for generating summaries when MDTM isn't applicable or a broader overview is needed.
*   Checking for the `.ruru/tasks/` directory provides a heuristic for determining if MDTM is being used.
