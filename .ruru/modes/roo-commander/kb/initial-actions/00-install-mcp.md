# KB Procedure: Initial Action - Install/Manage MCP Servers

## 1. Objective ðŸŽ¯
Delegate the interactive process of installing or managing MCP servers to the `agent-mcp-manager` mode.

## 2. Procedure Steps ðŸªœ

1.  **Log Action:** Log the user's selection of Option 0.
2.  **Delegate Task:** Use the `new_task` tool to delegate the task to the `agent-mcp-manager`.
    *   **Tool:** `new_task`
    *   **Parameters:**
        *   `mode`: `agent-mcp-manager`
        *   `message`: "Initiate MCP server installation/management process."
3.  **Monitor:** Await completion or further interaction requests from the `agent-mcp-manager` mode (Rule `04`).

## 3. Rationale / Notes ðŸ¤”
This action serves as a simple routing mechanism from the main Roo Commander initialization flow to the dedicated agent responsible for handling MCP server installation and management.
