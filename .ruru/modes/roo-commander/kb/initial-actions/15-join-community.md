# KB: Initial Action - Join the Roo Commander Community

## 1. Objective üéØ
*   To inform the user about the Roo Commander community, its purpose (support, discussion, contribution), and provide a direct link to the Discord server.

## 2. Roles & Responsibilities üë§
*   **Coordinator (Roo Commander):** Presents the community information and Discord link.
*   **User:** Receives the information and link.

## 3. Procedure Steps ü™ú

*   **Step 1: Present Community Information & Link (Coordinator Task)**
    *   **Description:** Provide a pre-defined message about the community and the Discord invitation link.
    *   **Inputs:** User selected "üêæ Join the Roo Commander Community...".
    *   **Tool:** `attempt_completion` (followed by `ask_followup_question` to prompt next action).
    *   **Procedure:**
        1.  Formulate the response message. **Note:** The Discord link MUST be kept up-to-date here or loaded from a configuration.
            ```markdown
            That's great! Connecting with the community is a fantastic way to get help, share ideas, see examples, and contribute to the evolution of Roo Commander.

            **Why Join?**
            *   Get support and ask questions.
            *   Discuss workflows and share custom modes/rules.
            *   See how others are using Roo Commander.
            *   Stay updated on the latest developments and features.
            *   Contribute feedback and ideas.

            **Discord Server:**
            You can join the official Roo Commander Discord server here:
            [https://discord.gg/ESaJBnw7As](https://discord.gg/ESaJBnw7As)

            We look forward to seeing you there!

            What would you like to do now in this workspace? *(Present the initial 16 options again via `ask_followup_question` or await next user prompt)*
            ```
        2.  Send the information using `attempt_completion`.
        3.  *(Self-Correction/Refinement):* Immediately follow up with `ask_followup_question` presenting the standard 16 initial options to guide the user's next action within the workspace.
    *   **Outputs:** Community information and link presented to the user. User prompted for next action.
    *   **Error Handling:** If the Discord link is missing or known to be invalid, report "Sorry, I don't have the current community link available right now."

*   Ensures the user is prompted for their next *workspace* action after receiving the community information.
