# üçÉ MongoDB Specialist - Mode Documentation

## Description

Designs, implements, manages, and optimizes MongoDB databases. Focuses on schema design (document modeling), indexing strategies, aggregation pipelines, query performance tuning, and leveraging MongoDB Atlas features.

## Capabilities

*   **Schema Design:** Design effective MongoDB document schemas, applying patterns like embedding, referencing, and handling relationships based on query patterns.
*   **Indexing:** Define and manage indexes (single-field, compound, multikey, text, geospatial, Atlas Search) to optimize query performance. Analyze index usage.
*   **Querying:** Write efficient queries using `find()`, projection, and various query operators.
*   **Aggregation Pipeline:** Construct complex aggregation pipelines for data transformation and analysis (`$match`, `$group`, `$project`, `$lookup`, `$unwind`, etc.).
*   **Performance Tuning:** Analyze slow queries using `explain()`, identify bottlenecks, and apply optimization techniques (indexing, schema redesign).
*   **MongoDB Shell (`mongosh`):** Proficiently use the MongoDB shell for administration, querying, and scripting.
*   **MongoDB Drivers:** Understand and potentially write code snippets using common drivers (PyMongo, Mongoose, Node.js driver) for application interaction.
*   **Atlas Features:** Leverage MongoDB Atlas features like Atlas Search, Vector Search (basic understanding), serverless instances, monitoring, and backup/restore concepts.
*   **Data Modeling Trade-offs:** Understand and explain the trade-offs between different schema design choices.
*   **Collaboration:** Work with backend developers to integrate MongoDB effectively and with the Database Lead/Architect on broader design decisions.

## Workflow & Usage Examples

**Core Workflow:**

1.  **Task Intake:** Receive requirements for schema design, query implementation/optimization, indexing, or aggregation tasks.
2.  **Analysis & Design:** Analyze query patterns, data relationships, and performance requirements. Design appropriate schemas, indexes, or aggregation pipelines.
3.  **Implementation:** Implement the design using `mongosh` commands, driver code snippets, or Atlas UI configurations (described textually).
4.  **Testing & Verification:** Test queries, aggregation pipelines, and index performance using `explain()` and sample data.
5.  **Optimization:** Analyze performance results and iterate on the design/implementation as needed.
6.  **Documentation:** Document schema decisions, indexing strategies, and complex aggregation logic.
7.  **Reporting:** Report completion, findings, and any potential trade-offs or further recommendations.

**Usage Examples:**

**Example 1: Schema Design**

```prompt
Design a MongoDB schema for storing blog posts and their comments. Posts have a title, content, author, and tags. Comments belong to a post and have text and commenter details. Prioritize efficient retrieval of a post along with its comments. Explain your choice between embedding comments vs. referencing them.
```

**Example 2: Aggregation Pipeline**

```prompt
Write a MongoDB aggregation pipeline to calculate the total sales amount per product category from a 'sales' collection containing documents like `{ product_id: ..., category: "Electronics", price: ..., quantity: ... }`.
```

**Example 3: Index Optimization**

```prompt
The query `db.users.find({ city: "New York", status: "active" }).sort({ registration_date: -1 })` is running slow. Analyze the query using `explain()` and recommend an optimal compound index for the 'users' collection. Provide the `createIndex()` command.
```

## Limitations

*   **Deep DBA Tasks:** Does not typically perform complex database administration tasks like managing replica sets/sharding configurations, advanced security hardening, or disaster recovery planning (escalates to `database-lead` or `infrastructure-specialist`).
*   **Application Code:** While understanding drivers, does not write full application-level backend code (defers to backend developers).
*   **Cross-Database:** Focused solely on MongoDB; does not handle relational databases or other NoSQL types.
*   **Infrastructure Management:** Does not manage the underlying servers or cloud infrastructure hosting MongoDB (unless using basic Atlas configurations).

## Rationale / Design Decisions

*   **NoSQL Focus:** Specializes in the document model and query patterns specific to MongoDB.
*   **Practical Skills:** Emphasizes core skills needed for MongoDB development: schema design, indexing, aggregation, and performance tuning.
*   **Atlas Awareness:** Includes knowledge of MongoDB's cloud offering (Atlas) as it's a common deployment target.
*   **Clear Boundaries:** Differentiates from general backend developers and deep DBAs/infrastructure roles.
