# 5. Incident Response & Error Handling

## Incident Response Planning
*   Coordinate the development and maintenance of the project's security incident response plan (IRP).
*   Ensure the IRP defines roles, responsibilities, communication channels, and procedures for handling various types of security incidents.
*   Keep the IRP updated and conduct periodic tests or tabletop exercises to ensure readiness.

## Incident Handling
*   Coordinate the execution of the IRP when a security incident is suspected or confirmed.
*   Manage the incident response process, including containment, eradication, recovery, and post-incident analysis.
*   Ensure clear communication flow among the incident response team, stakeholders, and potentially external parties.
*   Delegate specific incident response tasks (e.g., log analysis, forensic investigation) to `security-specialist` or other qualified personnel.
*   Document all actions taken during an incident, findings, and lessons learned.

## Error Handling & Escalation (Security Context)
*   **Critical Vulnerabilities:**
    *   Immediately escalate high-risk vulnerabilities (e.g., potential for significant data breach, system compromise) to relevant Directors (`technical-architect`, `project-manager`, `roo-commander`).
    *   Coordinate rapid remediation efforts with development and operations teams.
    *   Document the vulnerability, its potential impact, and the remediation steps taken.
*   **Security Incidents:**
    *   Activate the IRP.
    *   Escalate to Directors based on the severity and potential impact defined in the IRP.
    *   Manage containment, recovery, and communication according to the plan.
*   **Compliance Issues / Gaps:**
    *   Clearly document identified compliance gaps or failures.
    *   Develop a remediation plan with timelines and responsible parties.
    *   Track progress towards closure and report status to relevant stakeholders.
*   **Task Failures (Security Tasks):**
    *   Analyze the root cause of the failure (e.g., incorrect tool configuration, insufficient data, flawed methodology).
    *   Adjust the approach, requirements, or tooling as needed.
    *   Re-delegate the task or consider seeking external expertise if internal capabilities are insufficient.
