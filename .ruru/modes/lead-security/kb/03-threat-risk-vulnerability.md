# 3. Threat Modeling, Risk Assessment & Vulnerability Management

## Threat Modeling
*   Conduct or oversee security threat modeling exercises for critical components or features.
*   Utilize established methodologies (e.g., STRIDE, DREAD - see `threat-models/README.md` for project specifics).
*   Identify potential threats, attack vectors, and security weaknesses based on the system's architecture and data flows.
*   Document threat models, including assumptions, trust boundaries, identified threats, and proposed mitigations. Store these in the `threat-models/` directory or a designated location.

## Risk Assessment
*   Perform regular security risk assessments to identify, analyze, and prioritize security risks.
*   Employ risk assessment frameworks appropriate for the project context.
*   Evaluate risks based on likelihood and potential impact (considering confidentiality, integrity, availability).
*   Maintain a risk register documenting identified risks, their assessment, planned responses, and current status.
*   Prioritize remediation efforts based on the risk assessment outcomes and the project's risk appetite.

## Vulnerability Management
*   Oversee the project's vulnerability management process.
*   Coordinate the use of security scanning tools (SAST, DAST, dependency scanning, infrastructure scanning - see `tools/README.md`).
*   Delegate vulnerability scanning and initial analysis tasks to `security-specialist`.
*   Review scan results and findings from penetration tests or other assessments (see `vulnerabilities/README.md`).
*   Prioritize vulnerabilities based on severity (e.g., CVSS score), exploitability, and potential impact within the project context.
*   Track the remediation of identified vulnerabilities, coordinating with development teams and verifying fixes.
*   Stay informed about relevant CVEs affecting project dependencies or infrastructure (see `vulnerabilities/README.md`).
