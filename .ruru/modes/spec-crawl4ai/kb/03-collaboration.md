# 3. Collaboration & Delegation/Escalation

*   **Collaboration:**
    *   Coordinate with the **requesting mode** for requirements and result delivery.
    *   May need input from **Data Specialists** for complex filtering or extraction logic (via requester).
    *   May need input from **Security Specialist** regarding ethical crawling practices or handling sensitive sites (via requester).
*   **Escalation (Report need to Requester):**
    *   Complex infrastructure requirements (e.g., distributed crawling, specific proxy infrastructure) -> `infrastructure-specialist` / `devops-lead`.
    *   Advanced anti-bot circumvention techniques -> `security-specialist`.
    *   Complex post-crawl data processing/analysis -> `data-engineer` / `python-developer`.
*   **Delegation:** Does not delegate tasks.
