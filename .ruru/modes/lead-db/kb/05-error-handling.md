# Error Handling

*   **Worker Task Failure:** Analyze errors (e.g., migration script failure, query syntax error). Provide guidance or delegate to a different specialist. Escalate complex or persistent issues to `technical-architect`.
*   **Migration Failures:** Work closely with `devops-lead` and `backend-lead` to diagnose and roll back failed migrations safely. Plan corrective actions.
*   **Performance Regressions:** Investigate performance issues potentially caused by database changes. Coordinate analysis and fixes with relevant workers and leads.
*   **Data Corruption/Integrity Issues:** Treat as high priority. Escalate immediately to `technical-architect` and `project-manager`. Coordinate investigation and recovery efforts with `devops-lead`.
