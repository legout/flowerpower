# üõ†Ô∏è Frappe Specialist - Mode Documentation

## Description

Implements sophisticated solutions using the Frappe Framework, including DocTypes, Controllers, Server Scripts, Client Scripts, Permissions, Workflows, and Bench commands. Often used in the context of ERPNext customization.

## Capabilities

*   Create and customize Frappe DocTypes (schema, controllers, scripts).
*   Develop server-side logic using Python (Server Scripts, Whitelisted methods, Scheduled Jobs).
*   Implement client-side interactions and UI customizations using JavaScript (Client Scripts, Form Scripts).
*   Configure and manage Frappe permissions and roles.
*   Design and implement Frappe Workflows.
*   Utilize the Bench CLI for app management, migrations, updates, and deployment.
*   Write automated tests for Frappe applications.
*   Debug issues within the Frappe framework and custom apps.
*   Integrate Frappe with external systems via REST API.
*   Collaborate with database, API, infrastructure, and frontend specialists.
*   Process MDTM task files with status updates (if applicable).
*   Log progress, decisions, and results in project journals (if applicable).
*   Escalate complex or out-of-scope tasks appropriately.
*   Handle errors and report completion status.

## Workflow & Usage Examples

**Core Workflow:**

1.  **Task Intake:** Receive task (direct or MDTM), understand requirements, log initial goal.
2.  **Design/Implementation:**
    *   Define/modify DocTypes (`.json`, `.py`, `.js`).
    *   Write Server Scripts (`.py`) or Client Scripts (`.js`).
    *   Configure Workflows (`.json`).
    *   Adjust Permissions.
    *   Use Bench commands (`bench migrate`, `bench build`, etc.).
3.  **Testing:** Write and run tests (if applicable).
4.  **Debugging:** Identify and fix issues using Frappe's tools and logs.
5.  **Collaboration/Escalation:** Coordinate with other specialists or escalate if needed.
6.  **Logging & Reporting:** Log progress/completion, update task status, report back.

**Usage Examples:**

**Example 1: Create a Custom DocType**

```prompt
Create a new custom DocType named "Project Task" within the "projects" app. Include fields for "Subject" (Data), "Project" (Link to Project DocType), "Assigned To" (Link to User DocType), "Start Date" (Date), "End Date" (Date), and "Status" (Select with options: Open, In Progress, Completed). Generate the necessary `.json`, `.py`, and `.js` files using Bench commands if possible, or create them manually.
```

**Example 2: Add a Server Script**

```prompt
Create a Server Script for the "Sales Invoice" DocType that runs on "Before Save". The script should validate that if the "Customer" field belongs to the "Retail" Customer Group, the "Payment Terms Template" must be set to "Cash". If not, raise a validation error.
```

**Example 3: Customize a Form with a Client Script**

```prompt
Write a Client Script for the "Purchase Order" form. When the "Supplier" field changes, fetch the supplier's default "Payment Terms Template" using `frappe.call` and set it in the "Payment Terms Template" field on the Purchase Order form.
```

## Limitations

*   Primarily focused on the Frappe Framework and its standard features/APIs.
*   Assumes a working Frappe/ERPNext instance and Bench environment.
*   Does not handle complex frontend framework integrations (React, Vue, etc.) beyond standard Frappe UI capabilities (will escalate to `frontend-developer`).
*   Does not perform deep database administration or optimization beyond Frappe's ORM (will escalate to `database-specialist`).
*   Does not manage underlying server infrastructure, OS-level configurations, or complex deployment scenarios beyond standard Bench commands (will escalate to `devops-lead`, `infrastructure-specialist`).

## Rationale / Design Decisions

*   **Specialization:** Deep focus on the Frappe Framework ensures proficiency in its specific architecture, APIs, and conventions (DocTypes, scripting, Bench).
*   **Ecosystem Context:** Explicitly mentions ERPNext as a common use case.
*   **Clear Boundaries:** Defines limitations regarding advanced frontend, database, and infrastructure tasks, setting expectations for collaboration and escalation.
*   **File Access:** Scoped to typical Frappe app file structures (`doctype`, `page`, `report`, `server_script`, `client_script`, `hooks.py`, etc.).
