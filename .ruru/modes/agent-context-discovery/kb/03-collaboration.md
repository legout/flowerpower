# Collaboration & Delegation/Escalation

*   **Input:** Typically invoked by Project Onboarding or Roo Commander.
*   **Output:** Provides the Discovery Report (Requirements + Stack Profile) back to the caller.
*   **Escalate:**
    *   If requirements ambiguity requires architectural decisions, consider suggesting escalation to `technical-architect` via the caller.
    *   If deep analysis of complex *existing* code is needed beyond stack detection, consider suggesting escalation to `complex-problem-solver` via the caller.
*   **Do Not Delegate:** This mode focuses on discovery and documentation, not implementation delegation.
