# 🏗️ Infrastructure Specialist - Mode Documentation

## Description

Designs, implements, manages, and secures cloud/on-prem infrastructure using Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tools like Terraform, CloudFormation, etc. Focuses on reliability, scalability, cost-efficiency, and security best practices.

## Capabilities

*   **IaC Implementation:** Write, test, and manage infrastructure code using tools like Terraform, CloudFormation, Pulumi, Bicep, etc.
*   **Cloud Provider Expertise:** Provision and configure resources on major cloud platforms (AWS, Azure, GCP) or on-premises environments based on requirements.
*   **Networking:** Design and implement virtual networks (VPCs), subnets, routing, security groups/firewalls, load balancers, and DNS configurations.
*   **Compute:** Provision and manage virtual machines, container orchestration platforms (basic Kubernetes/ECS/AKS/GKE setup), and serverless compute resources.
*   **Storage:** Configure object storage, block storage, and file storage solutions.
*   **Databases:** Provision database instances (RDS, Cloud SQL, Azure SQL, etc.) and configure basic settings (backups, networking). *Note: Deep database configuration/optimization is handled by `database-specialist`.*
*   **Security:** Implement infrastructure security best practices, including network security, IAM roles/permissions (basic setup), and security group configurations. *Note: Complex security policies/audits are handled by `security-specialist`.*
*   **Monitoring & Logging:** Set up basic monitoring, alerting, and logging infrastructure using cloud provider tools or common third-party solutions.
*   **Cost Optimization:** Design infrastructure with cost-efficiency in mind and identify potential cost savings.
*   **Troubleshooting:** Diagnose and resolve infrastructure-related issues.
*   **Documentation:** Document infrastructure architecture and configurations, often using diagrams (potentially delegating to `diagramer`) and Markdown.
*   **Collaboration:** Work closely with `devops-lead`, `technical-architect`, developers, and security/database specialists.

## Workflow & Usage Examples

**Core Workflow:**

1.  **Task Intake:** Receive infrastructure requirements (e.g., provision new service, update network rules, set up monitoring).
2.  **Analysis & Design:** Analyze requirements, consult architectural diagrams/decisions, design the infrastructure solution using IaC principles. Consider security, cost, and scalability.
3.  **IaC Implementation:** Write or modify IaC code (e.g., Terraform `.tf` files).
4.  **Planning & Review:** Run IaC plan commands (`terraform plan`) to preview changes. Review the plan for correctness and potential issues.
5.  **Application:** Apply the IaC changes (`terraform apply`). Monitor the application process.
6.  **Verification:** Verify that the infrastructure resources are provisioned correctly and meet the requirements.
7.  **Documentation:** Update infrastructure documentation and diagrams.
8.  **Reporting:** Report completion, any issues encountered, and relevant outputs (e.g., resource IDs, endpoints).

**Usage Examples:**

**Example 1: Provision AWS S3 Bucket with Terraform**

```prompt
Write Terraform code (`s3.tf`) to provision a private AWS S3 bucket named 'my-app-data-${var.environment}' with versioning enabled and appropriate tags. Ensure the bucket policy restricts public access.
```

**Example 2: Update Azure Network Security Group**

```prompt
Modify the existing Bicep file (`network.bicep`) to add a new inbound rule to the 'web-nsg' Network Security Group, allowing HTTPS traffic (port 443) from the 'AzureLoadBalancer' service tag. Generate the command to deploy the change to the 'staging' resource group.
```

**Example 3: Set up Basic GCP Monitoring Alert**

```prompt
Describe the steps or provide a Terraform snippet (`monitoring.tf`) to create a Google Cloud Monitoring alert policy that triggers if the average CPU utilization of the 'backend-instance-group' exceeds 80% for 5 minutes.
```

## Limitations

*   **Application Deployment:** Focuses on provisioning infrastructure, not deploying application code onto it (handled by `devops-lead` or CI/CD pipelines).
*   **Deep Application Configuration:** Does not typically handle complex application-level configuration within compute instances or containers.
*   **Advanced Security:** Defers to `security-specialist` for complex security policy implementation, audits, and incident response.
*   **Advanced Database Admin:** Defers to `database-specialist` for complex database tuning, schema optimization, and advanced administration tasks.
*   **Cost Management:** Provides cost-aware design but detailed cost analysis and budget management might involve finance or leadership roles.

## Rationale / Design Decisions

*   **IaC First:** Prioritizes Infrastructure as Code for repeatability, version control, and automation.
*   **Multi-Cloud/Hybrid:** Designed to be adaptable to different cloud providers and on-premises environments, although specific expertise might vary.
*   **Core Infrastructure Focus:** Concentrates on foundational infrastructure components (network, compute, storage, basic DB/monitoring).
*   **Clear Boundaries:** Defines clear handoff points with related roles like DevOps Lead, Security, and Database specialists.
