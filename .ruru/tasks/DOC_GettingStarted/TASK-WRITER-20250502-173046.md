# Task: Create Getting Started Document for flowerpower

## 🎯 Goal
Create a concise "Getting Started" document for the `flowerpower` Python library.

## 📖 Source Material
The **only** source of information for this document is the provided `repomix-output.md` file. Analyze its content, particularly the directory structure and code snippets, to understand the library's core functionality and how a user might start using it.

## 📝 Deliverable
A new Markdown file located at `docs/getting_started.md`.

## 📄 Required Sections
The document should include at least the following sections:

1.  **Introduction/Overview:** Briefly describe what `flowerpower` is based on the available information.
2.  **Installation:** Infer installation steps if possible (e.g., look for `pyproject.toml` dependencies). If not inferable, state that installation details are TBD or point to `pyproject.toml`.
3.  **Basic Usage/Example:** Extract a simple, illustrative example from the `examples/` directory shown in `repomix-output.md`. Choose one that demonstrates core functionality clearly.
4.  **(Optional) Configuration:** If configuration files (`.yml`) seem central to usage based on examples, briefly mention their role.
5.  **(Optional) Running Examples:** Briefly explain how a user might run one of the provided examples.
