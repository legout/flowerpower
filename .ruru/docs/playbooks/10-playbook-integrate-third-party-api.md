# Project Playbook: Integrating a Third-Party API

This playbook outlines a recommended approach for integrating an external, third-party API (like `[API Provider Name]`) to add `[Specific Functionality]` to your application, using Roo Commander's Epic-Feature-Task hierarchy.

**Scenario:** Your application needs to interact with an external service (e.g., process payments, send SMS, perform advanced search) provided by `[API Provider Name]`.

## Phase 1: Research, Design & Planning

1.  **Define the Integration Goal (Epic/Feature):**
    *   **Goal:** Clearly state why the integration is needed and what specific capability it will provide.
    *   **Action:** Create an Epic (for major integrations) or Feature (for smaller ones), e.g., `.ruru/epics/EPIC-025-integrate-[api_name_placeholder].md` or `.ruru/features/FEAT-090-add-[api_name_placeholder]-[functionality_placeholder].md`.
    *   **Content:** Define the `objective` (e.g., "Integrate Stripe API to process user subscription payments"), `scope_description` (which specific API endpoints/features are needed), expected benefits. Set `status` to "Planned".

2.  **API Research & Evaluation (Feature/Tasks):**
    *   **Goal:** Thoroughly understand the relevant parts of the `[API Provider Name]` API.
    *   **Action:** Define as a Feature (`FEAT-091-research-[api_name_placeholder]-api.md`). Delegate tasks to `agent-research`.
    *   **Tasks (Examples):**
        *   "Find official documentation for `[API Provider Name]` API related to `[Specific Functionality]`."
        *   "Identify required API endpoints, request/response formats, and data models."
        *   "Determine the authentication method required (API Key, OAuth, etc.)."
        *   "Research available official SDKs (Software Development Kits) for [Backend Language/Frontend Framework]."
        *   "Investigate rate limits, pricing tiers, and potential error codes."
    *   **Output:** Summarize findings in the Feature description or a linked document in `.ruru/docs/research/`.

3.  **Integration Strategy & Design (Feature/ADR):**
    *   **Goal:** Decide *how* the integration will work within your application architecture.
    *   **Action:** Define as a Feature (`FEAT-092-design-[api_name_placeholder]-integration.md`). Delegate to `core-architect`, `lead-backend`, `lead-frontend`.
    *   **Key Decisions:**
        *   **Client-Side vs. Server-Side:** Will the frontend call the API directly (only if safe, e.g., public search keys) or will the backend act as a proxy/wrapper (more common and secure for sensitive operations)?
        *   **Data Flow:** How does data move between your app, your backend, and the third-party API?
        *   **Error Handling:** How will API errors from the third party be handled and presented to the user?
        *   **Asynchronous Operations:** Does the API involve webhooks or long-running tasks? How will these be handled?
    *   **Output:** Create an ADR (`.ruru/decisions/`) detailing the chosen architecture (e.g., "Server-Side Wrapper for Stripe API"). Define the API contract for any internal backend endpoints created.

4.  **Security & Secret Management Plan:**
    *   **Goal:** Plan how API keys/secrets will be handled securely.
    *   **Action:** Define as part of the Design Feature or a separate task. Consult `lead-security`.
    *   **Tasks (Examples):**
        *   "Identify required API keys/secrets for different environments (dev, staging, prod)."
        *   "Define strategy for storing secrets (e.g., environment variables, cloud secret manager)."
        *   "Ensure secrets are NOT committed to Git (add to `.gitignore` if needed)."
    *   **Output:** Document the plan in the ADR or Feature file.

## Phase 2: Implementation (Backend & Frontend Features)

*(Structure depends heavily on the chosen strategy - Server-Side Wrapper example below)*

1.  **Implement Backend Wrapper/Service (Feature):**
    *   **Goal:** Create server-side code that securely interacts with the `[API Provider Name]` API.
    *   **Action:** Define as a Feature (`FEAT-093-backend-[api_name_placeholder]-service.md`). Decompose into Tasks.
    *   **Tasks (Examples - Delegate to `dev-api`, Backend Specialist):**
        *   "Install official `[API Provider Name]` SDK for [Backend Language]."
        *   "Create service module/class `[ApiName]Service.ts`."
        *   "Implement function `create[Resource](...)` that securely retrieves API key from environment/secrets and calls the relevant SDK method."
        *   "Implement functions for other needed API interactions (e.g., `get[Resource]`, `perform[Action]`)."
        *   "Implement robust error handling for API calls (catching exceptions, mapping errors)."
        *   "Create internal API endpoints (e.g., `POST /api/internal/[resource]`) that use the service to expose functionality safely to the frontend."
        *   "Add authentication/authorization checks to internal endpoints."
    *   **Process:** Use MDTM workflow, link tasks to Feature. **Emphasize secure credential handling.**

2.  **Implement Frontend Integration (Feature):**
    *   **Goal:** Build the UI elements and logic to interact with *your backend wrapper* (not the third-party API directly, in this example).
    *   **Action:** Define as a Feature (`FEAT-094-frontend-[api_name_placeholder]-integration.md`). Decompose into Tasks.
    *   **Tasks (Examples - Delegate to `lead-frontend`, Framework Specialist):**
        *   "Create UI component `[Feature]Component.vue` for `[Specific Functionality]`."
        *   "Implement API call from frontend component to *your backend endpoint* (e.g., `POST /api/internal/[resource]`)."
        *   "Handle loading states while waiting for the backend response."
        *   "Display results or handle errors returned from *your backend*."
    *   **Process:** Use MDTM workflow, link tasks to Feature.

## Phase 3: Testing & Verification

1.  **Backend Integration Testing:**
    *   **Goal:** Test the backend service/wrapper in isolation.
    *   **Action:** Define Tasks under the Backend Feature (`FEAT-093`). Delegate to `test-integration`.
    *   **Process:** Write tests that call your internal API endpoints. **Crucially, mock the calls to the actual third-party API** to avoid real transactions/costs and ensure repeatable tests. Verify your wrapper handles success and error responses from the (mocked) third-party correctly.

2.  **End-to-End Testing:**
    *   **Goal:** Test the full user flow involving the integration.
    *   **Action:** Define Tasks (`FEAT-095-e2e-test-[api_name_placeholder]-flow.md` or add to existing features). Delegate to `test-e2e`.
    *   **Process:** Write E2E tests simulating user interaction (e.g., filling a form, clicking button) that triggers the frontend, which calls the backend, which (in a controlled test environment, possibly using test keys/modes provided by the API provider) interacts with the actual third-party API.

3.  **Security Review:**
    *   **Goal:** Verify secure implementation, especially secret handling.
    *   **Action:** Assign task to `lead-security`.
    *   **Process:** Review code handling API keys/secrets, check for vulnerabilities related to the integration point.

## Phase 4: Documentation & Finalization

1.  **Internal Documentation:**
    *   **Goal:** Document how to configure and use the integration internally.
    *   **Action:** Define Task under relevant Feature. Delegate to `util-writer`.
    *   **Content:** Document required environment variables, how the internal API wrapper works, common error handling.

2.  **Update User Documentation (If Applicable):**
    *   **Goal:** Inform end-users about the new capability.
    *   **Action:** Define Task. Delegate to `util-writer`.

3.  **Final Review & Completion:**
    *   **Action:** Review completed Features and Tasks. Mark Features and the parent Epic as "Done".

## Key Considerations for API Integration:

*   **Security:** NEVER commit API keys or secrets. Use environment variables or a secure secret management system. Prefer server-side integrations for sensitive operations.
*   **Error Handling:** Third-party APIs can fail. Implement robust error handling, retries (with backoff), and user-friendly error messages.
*   **Rate Limits:** Be aware of and respect the API provider's rate limits. Implement caching or queuing if necessary.
*   **SDKs:** Use official SDKs when available; they often handle authentication, retries, and complex request building.
*   **Testing:** Mocking the external API is essential for reliable backend/integration tests. Use test environments/keys provided by the API vendor for E2E tests where possible.
*   **Data Privacy:** Understand what data is being sent to the third party and ensure compliance with privacy regulations (GDPR, CCPA, etc.).
*   **Cost:** Be aware of the pricing model for the third-party API.

This playbook provides a framework for integrating external services, emphasizing security, design, and testing.
