# Project Playbook: Implementing User Authentication

This playbook outlines a recommended approach for implementing a user authentication system, often a foundational part of web applications, using Roo Commander's Epic-Feature-Task hierarchy.

**Scenario:** You need to add the ability for users to sign up, log in, log out, and have their sessions managed securely in your web application.

## Phase 1: Planning & Design

1.  **Define the Authentication Epic:**
    *   **Goal:** Establish the high-level requirements for the entire authentication system.
    *   **Action:** Create the main Epic (e.g., `.ruru/epics/EPIC-001-user-authentication-system.md`).
    *   **Content:** Define the `objective` (e.g., "Implement a secure and user-friendly authentication system allowing users to sign up, log in, and manage their sessions"), `scope_description` (e.g., "Includes email/password auth, session management, basic route protection. Excludes social logins initially."), key security requirements. Set `status` to "Planned".

2.  **Choose Authentication Strategy & Provider (Architectural Decision):**
    *   **Goal:** Decide on the core mechanism (e.g., session cookies, JWTs) and whether to use a third-party provider (Auth0, Clerk, Firebase Auth, Supabase Auth, custom implementation).
    *   **Action:** Delegate research/comparison to `agent-research` or `core-architect`. Discuss pros/cons with user/team.
    *   **Output:** Create an ADR (`.ruru/decisions/`) documenting the chosen strategy and provider (e.g., `ADR-002-auth-strategy-jwt-custom.md`).

3.  **Design Data Model Changes:**
    *   **Goal:** Define necessary changes to the user database schema.
    *   **Action:** Delegate to `lead-db` or `data-specialist`.
    *   **Tasks (Examples):** "Design `users` table schema including hashed password field", "Design `sessions` table schema (if using custom sessions)". Document in feature file or separate design doc.

4.  **Break Down into Core Features:**
    *   **Goal:** Define the main user-facing features of the authentication system.
    *   **Action:** Create Feature files (`.ruru/features/`) linked to the Epic.
    *   **Feature Examples:**
        *   `FEAT-010-user-signup.md` (Epic: EPIC-001)
        *   `FEAT-011-user-login.md` (Epic: EPIC-001)
        *   `FEAT-012-user-logout.md` (Epic: EPIC-001)
        *   `FEAT-013-session-management-middleware.md` (Epic: EPIC-001)
        *   `FEAT-014-protected-route-implementation.md` (Epic: EPIC-001)
    *   **Process:** Define `description` and `acceptance_criteria` for each. Set `status` to "Draft" or "Ready for Dev". Update Epic's `related_features`.

## Phase 2: Backend Implementation (Per Feature)

1.  **Implement Signup Feature Tasks:**
    *   **Goal:** Build the backend logic for user registration.
    *   **Action:** Decompose `FEAT-010` into Tasks.
    *   **Tasks (Examples - Delegate to `dev-api`, `lead-db`):**
        *   "Create database migration for `users` table."
        *   "Implement password hashing utility."
        *   "Create `/api/auth/signup` endpoint: validate input, check existing user, hash password, store user, return success/error."
        *   "Write unit/integration tests for signup logic."
    *   **Process:** Use MDTM workflow, link tasks to `FEAT-010`.

2.  **Implement Login Feature Tasks:**
    *   **Goal:** Build the backend logic for user login and session/token creation.
    *   **Action:** Decompose `FEAT-011` into Tasks.
    *   **Tasks (Examples - Delegate to `dev-api`):**
        *   "Create `/api/auth/login` endpoint: validate input, find user, verify password hash, generate session/JWT, return token/session ID/user info."
        *   "Implement session storage/JWT signing logic (if custom)."
        *   "Write tests for login logic."
    *   **Process:** Use MDTM workflow, link tasks to `FEAT-011`.

3.  **Implement Logout Feature Tasks:**
    *   **Goal:** Build the backend logic for invalidating sessions/tokens.
    *   **Action:** Decompose `FEAT-012` into Tasks.
    *   **Tasks (Examples - Delegate to `dev-api`):**
        *   "Create `/api/auth/logout` endpoint: invalidate session/token (e.g., delete from DB, add to blocklist)."
        *   "Write tests for logout."
    *   **Process:** Use MDTM workflow, link tasks to `FEAT-012`.

4.  **Implement Session Middleware/Guards (Feature):**
    *   **Goal:** Create backend middleware to verify session/token on protected routes.
    *   **Action:** Decompose `FEAT-013` into Tasks.
    *   **Tasks (Examples - Delegate to `dev-api` or framework specialist):**
        *   "Implement middleware to extract token/session ID from request."
        *   "Implement logic to validate token/session against storage/provider."
        *   "Attach user information to request object on successful validation."
        *   "Apply middleware to relevant API route groups."
    *   **Process:** Use MDTM workflow, link tasks to `FEAT-013`.

## Phase 3: Frontend Implementation (Per Feature)

1.  **Implement Signup UI & Logic (Feature):**
    *   **Goal:** Build the frontend signup form and connect it to the backend API.
    *   **Action:** Decompose `FEAT-010` further into frontend Tasks.
    *   **Tasks (Examples - Delegate to `lead-frontend`, framework specialist):**
        *   "Create `SignupForm.vue` component with email/password fields."
        *   "Implement form validation logic."
        *   "Implement API call to `/api/auth/signup` on form submit."
        *   "Handle success (e.g., redirect to login/dashboard) and error responses (display messages)."
    *   **Process:** Use MDTM workflow, link tasks to `FEAT-010`.

2.  **Implement Login UI & Logic (Feature):**
    *   **Goal:** Build the frontend login form, connect to API, handle auth state.
    *   **Action:** Decompose `FEAT-011` further into frontend Tasks.
    *   **Tasks (Examples):**
        *   "Create `LoginForm.vue` component."
        *   "Implement API call to `/api/auth/login`."
        *   "On success, store session/token securely (e.g., secure cookie, local storage - consider security)."
        *   "Update global application state (e.g., Redux/Zustand/Pinia store) to reflect logged-in user."
        *   "Redirect user upon successful login."
    *   **Process:** Use MDTM workflow, link tasks to `FEAT-011`.

3.  **Implement Logout Logic (Feature):**
    *   **Goal:** Provide a way for users to log out and clear auth state.
    *   **Action:** Decompose `FEAT-012` further into frontend Tasks.
    *   **Tasks (Examples):**
        *   "Add Logout button to user menu/nav bar."
        *   "Implement API call to `/api/auth/logout` on button click."
        *   "Clear stored session/token from client-side."
        *   "Clear user state from global store."
        *   "Redirect user to login page."
    *   **Process:** Use MDTM workflow, link tasks to `FEAT-012`.

4.  **Implement Protected Routes (Feature):**
    *   **Goal:** Prevent unauthenticated users from accessing certain pages/routes.
    *   **Action:** Decompose `FEAT-014` into Tasks.
    *   **Tasks (Examples - Delegate to framework specialist):**
        *   "Implement routing middleware/guard that checks authentication state."
        *   "Redirect unauthenticated users attempting to access protected routes to the login page."
        *   "Apply guard to necessary application routes."
    *   **Process:** Use MDTM workflow, link tasks to `FEAT-014`.

## Phase 4: Testing & Completion

1.  **End-to-End Testing:**
    *   **Goal:** Verify the complete authentication flow works as expected.
    *   **Action:** Define and delegate E2E tests (`test-e2e`) covering signup -> login -> accessing protected route -> logout. Create tasks linked to relevant features.
    *   **Process:** Run tests, create bug-fix tasks if needed.

2.  **Security Review (Recommended):**
    *   **Goal:** Identify potential security vulnerabilities.
    *   **Action:** Assign task(s) to `lead-security` to review the implementation (password hashing, session handling, input validation, protection against common attacks like CSRF/XSS if applicable).

3.  **Final Review & Documentation:**
    *   **Action:** Review completed features. Update user documentation (`util-writer`) regarding login/signup. Mark Features and the Epic as "Done".

## Key Considerations for Authentication:

*   **Security:** This is paramount. Use strong password hashing (e.g., bcrypt, Argon2). Protect against CSRF, XSS. Validate all inputs. Consider rate limiting. Securely store tokens/session IDs. Use HTTPS.
*   **Third-Party Providers:** Using services like Clerk, Firebase Auth, Supabase Auth, Auth0 can significantly simplify implementation and improve security, handling many complexities for you. The playbook would adapt based on the chosen provider (less backend API work, more SDK integration).
*   **User Experience:** Provide clear error messages, handle loading states, implement password reset flows early.
*   **State Management:** Choose and implement a consistent way to manage authentication state on the frontend.

This playbook provides a detailed structure for implementing a core authentication system, adaptable whether building from scratch or using a provider.
