# Roo Commander Version Naming Convention

## Introduction

This document outlines the new naming convention adopted for major releases of the Roo Commander mode, starting from version 7 (v7).

## The New Naming Scheme: Australian Fauna

To enhance memorability and reinforce the unique identity of Roo Commander, each major release will now be assigned a codename based on **Australian Marsupials and notable Fauna**.

This replaces the previous system of using only sequential version numbers (e.g., v6).

## Rationale

The Australian Fauna theme was chosen for several reasons:

*   **Thematic Relevance:** It directly connects with the "Roo" in Roo Commander, strengthening the project's branding.
*   **Memorability:** Using distinct animal names makes specific versions easier to recall and discuss than just numbers.
*   **Personality:** It adds a unique and engaging character to the release cycle.
*   **Longevity:** Australia's diverse fauna provides a rich source of names for future releases.

## Inaugural Release (v7)

The first version to adopt this new convention is:

**v7: Wallaby**

## Future Releases

Subsequent major releases will continue this pattern, drawing names sequentially or thematically from Australian wildlife (potential examples include Wombat, Koala, Quokka, Bilby, etc.). The version number (e.g., v8, v9) will always accompany the codename.

## Summary

This naming convention aims to make tracking Roo Commander's evolution more intuitive, thematic, and enjoyable for everyone involved. Both the version number and the codename (e.g., "v7: Wallaby") should be used when referring to specific major releases going forward.
