## 1. Goal & Scope üéØ

*   **Goal:** Clearly state the overall objective of this workflow/lifecycle. What high-level outcome does it achieve?
*   **Scope:** Define the boundaries. When does this workflow start and end? What activities are included? What is explicitly excluded?

## 2. Core Principles / Concepts üí°

*   Outline the fundamental ideas or principles guiding this workflow (e.g., Iteration, Confidence Scoring, Simulation, User Control).
*   Include analogies if helpful.

## 3. Roles & Responsibilities üë•

*   List the key agents or roles involved in this workflow.
*   Briefly describe the primary responsibilities of each role *within the context of this specific workflow*.
    *   **[Role 1 (e.g., Coordinator)]**: ...
    *   **[Role 2 (e.g., Specialist)]**: ...
    *   **[Role 3 (e.g., Reviewer)]**: ...
    *   **[Role 4 (e.g., User)]**: ...

## 4. Workflow Phases & Steps üöÄ

*(Structure the workflow into logical phases. Within each phase, detail the steps)*

### Phase 1: [Phase Name (e.g., Preparation, Drafting)]

1.  **Step 1.1: [Action Description]**
    *   **Actor:** [Role Name]
    *   **Details:** Provide specific instructions. Mention tools (`read_file`, `execute_command`, `new_task`, etc.) if applicable.
    *   **Inputs:** What information/artifacts are needed for this step?
    *   **Context (If Delegating):** Specify exactly what information/paths must be passed.
    *   **Output/Confirmation:** What is the expected result or state after this step?
2.  **Step 1.2: [Action Description]**
    *   **Actor:** [Role Name]
    *   ...

### Phase 2: [Phase Name (e.g., Execution, Review, Simulation)]

1.  **Step 2.1: [Action Description]**
    *   **Actor:** [Role Name]
    *   **Details:** ...
    *   **Decision Point Example:** If [Condition], proceed to Step 2.2, else proceed to Phase 3.
2.  **Step 2.2: ...**
    *   ...

### Phase 3: [Phase Name (e.g., Refinement, Finalization)]

1.  **Step 3.1: ...**
    *   ...

*(Continue adding phases and steps as needed)*

## 5. Key Artifacts / State üì¶

*   List the main documents, files, or significant state changes produced or managed by this workflow.
*   Example: "Draft SOP document", "QA Feedback report", "Finalized mode definition", "User Caution Level setting".

## 6. Integration Points üîó

*   Describe how this workflow interacts with or triggers other processes (e.g., "This workflow triggers the ACQA process at Phase X", "Results feed into the AFR process").
*   Reference related documents mentioned earlier.

## 7. Error Handling & Escalation ‚ö†Ô∏è

*   Describe how to handle common errors or deviations within the workflow.
*   Specify escalation paths for complex issues or recurring problems (e.g., "If simulation fails repeatedly, consult User", "Trigger AFR if QA pattern detected").

## 8. Benefits / Rationale ü§î

*   Explain *why* this workflow exists and the advantages it provides (e.g., "Improves reliability", "Standardizes process", "Balances speed and quality").

## 9. Future Considerations / Next Steps (Optional) ‚ú®

*   List potential improvements, planned extensions, or next steps related to this workflow.
