# Documentation: Template `07_adr.md`

## Purpose

This template is used for documenting significant Architecture Decision Records (ADRs). ADRs capture important architectural decisions, their context, rationale, and consequences, providing a historical record for the project team. ADR files are typically stored in the `.ruru/decisions/` directory.

## Usage

1.  Copy `.ruru/templates/toml-md/07_adr.md` to the `.ruru/decisions/` directory.
2.  Rename the file following a convention like `ADR-NNN_short_description.md` (e.g., `ADR-001_message_queue_choice.md`).
3.  Fill in the TOML frontmatter fields according to the schema below, ensuring `id` and `title` are set.
4.  Replace the placeholder content in the Markdown body with the specific details of the architectural decision, context, rationale, and consequences.

## TOML Schema

The following fields are defined within the `+++` delimiters:

*   `id` (String, Required):
    *   A unique identifier for the ADR, typically sequential (e.g., "ADR-001", "ADR-002").

*   `title` (String, Required):
    *   A short, descriptive title summarizing the decision.
    *   Example: `"Choice of Message Queue Technology"`, `"Adoption of Monorepo Structure"`

*   `status` (String, Required):
    *   The current status of the decision.
    *   Allowed values: `"proposed"`, `"accepted"`, `"rejected"`, `"deprecated"`, `"superseded"`.

*   `decision_date` (String, Required):
    *   The date the decision was finalized (status moved to accepted/rejected/etc.), in `YYYY-MM-DD` format.

*   `authors` (Array of Strings, Required):
    *   List of individuals or roles who authored or significantly contributed to the decision.
    *   Example: `["üßë‚Äçüíª User:ArchitectName", "ü§ñ technical-architect", "Team:Platform"]`

*   `template_schema_doc` (String, Required):
    *   A relative path pointing to this documentation file.
    *   Value: `".ruru/templates/toml-md/07_adr.README.md"`

*   `affected_components` (Array of Strings, Optional):
    *   List of system components, modules, or features significantly impacted by this decision.
    *   Example: `["auth-service", "order-processing", "frontend-app"]`

*   `tags` (Array of Strings, Required):
    *   Keywords for searching and filtering ADRs.
    *   Example: `["architecture", "backend", "messaging", "database", "monorepo", "performance"]`

*   `supersedes_adr` (String, Optional):
    *   The `id` of another ADR that this decision replaces or makes obsolete.
    *   Example: `"ADR-001"`
