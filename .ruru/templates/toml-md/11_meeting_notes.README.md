# Documentation: Template `11_meeting_notes.md`

## Purpose

This template is used for recording minutes, decisions, and action items from meetings. It provides a structured format for capturing key information discussed during a meeting. These notes are typically stored in `.ruru/docs/meetings/` or a project-specific `notes/` directory.

## Usage

1.  Copy `.ruru/templates/toml-md/11_meeting_notes.md` to the appropriate directory.
2.  Rename the file descriptively, often including the date (e.g., `2025-04-17_planning_meeting.md`).
3.  Fill in the TOML frontmatter fields according to the schema below, including `title`, `meeting_date`, `facilitator`, `note_taker`, and `participants`.
4.  Replace the placeholder content in the Markdown body with the actual meeting agenda, discussion points, decisions, and action items. Use GFM checklists (`- [ ]`) for action items.
