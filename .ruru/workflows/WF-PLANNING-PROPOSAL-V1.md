# Workflow: Planning Proposal Creation

## 1. Objective üéØ
*   To define a structured process for capturing, refining, and documenting planning proposals based on user input.

## 2. Scope ‚ÜîÔ∏è
*   Applies to the creation of planning proposals initiated by a user, involving input capture, interactive refinement, whitepaper generation, and implementation document creation within the `.ruru/planning/` directory structure.

## 3. Roles & Responsibilities üë§
*   **`prime-coordinator`**: Initiates the workflow, manages file/directory creation, orchestrates delegation to specialist modes, ensures all steps are completed.
*   **`ask` / `core-architect`**: Interactively refines the proposal idea with the user, clarifies requirements, identifies potential issues or improvements.
*   **`technical-writer`**: Generates the formal whitepaper based on the refined proposal details.
*   **`project-manager` / `core-architect`**: Generates implementation-focused documents (plans, concerns, etc.) based on the refined proposal.

## 4. Preconditionsüö¶
*   User provides an initial request to create a planning proposal.
*   User provides initial input in the form of text, file paths, or both.
*   `prime-coordinator` has the necessary context about the user's request.

## 5. Reference Documents & Tools üìöüõ†Ô∏è
*   Rules: `.roo/rules/01-standard-toml-md-format.md`
*   Tools: `write_to_file`, `ask_followup_question`, `new_task`, `read_file`, `list_files` (potentially for verifying input file paths).

## 6. Workflow Steps ü™ú

*   **Step 1: Initiation & Input Capture (Coordinator Task)**
    *   **Description:** Receive the user's request and initial input. Determine a suitable, filesystem-safe name for the proposal (`[ProposalName]`). Create the necessary directory structure and save the initial input.
    *   **Inputs:** User request, initial text/file paths.
    *   **Procedure:**
        1.  Analyze the user input to derive a concise `[ProposalName]` (e.g., "Feature_UserAuth", "Refactor_DatabaseSchema"). Sanitize the name for filesystem compatibility.
        2.  Define the base path: `proposal_base_path = ".ruru/planning/[ProposalName]"`
        3.  Define the input path: `input_path = proposal_base_path + "/input"`
        4.  Use `write_to_file` (or potentially `execute_command` with `mkdir -p`) to ensure `input_path` exists. *Confirmation required before write.*
        5.  If text input is provided, save it to a file like `input_path/initial_request.md` using `write_to_file`. *Confirmation required.*
        6.  If file paths are provided:
            *   *(Optional)* Verify file existence using `list_files` or `read_file` on the provided paths.
            *   Copy the input files into the `input_path` directory. This might require coordination with the user or using file system tools if direct copying isn't possible via standard tools (consider `execute_command` with `cp` if necessary and OS-aware).
    *   **Outputs:** Created directory structure `.ruru/planning/[ProposalName]/input/`, saved initial input files.
    *   **Error Handling:** If directory creation fails, report error. If input files cannot be accessed/copied, inform the user and potentially ask for clarification or alternative input methods.

*   **Step 2: Proposal Refinement (Coordinator delegates to `ask` or `core-architect`)**
    *   **Description:** Interactively refine the initial proposal idea with the user to clarify goals, scope, requirements, and potential challenges.
    *   **Tool:** `new_task`
    *   **Inputs Provided by Coordinator:**
        *   Path to the proposal directory: `proposal_base_path`.
        *   Path to the input files/text: `input_path`.
        *   Summary of the initial proposal idea.
    *   **Instructions for Delegate (`ask` / `core-architect`):**
        *   "Review the initial proposal input located at `[input_path]`."
        *   "Engage the user in a dialogue using `ask_followup_question` to refine the proposal. Focus on clarifying: goals, scope, key features/requirements, potential challenges, success metrics, non-goals."
        *   "Summarize the refined proposal, including key decisions and clarifications."
        *   "Save the summary and key discussion points to a file named `Refinement_Notes.md` within the `[proposal_base_path]` directory using `write_to_file`." *Confirmation required before write.*
        *   "Report completion, providing the path to the `Refinement_Notes.md` file."
    *   **Expected Output from Delegate:** Confirmation of completion, path to `Refinement_Notes.md`.
    *   **Coordinator Action (Post-Delegation):** Await confirmation. Verify the `Refinement_Notes.md` file exists. Log completion of refinement. Proceed to Step 3.
    *   **Error Handling:** If the delegate fails or the user is unresponsive, log the issue and potentially pause the workflow, informing the user.

*   **Step 3: Whitepaper Generation (Coordinator delegates to `technical-writer`)**
    *   **Description:** Generate a formal whitepaper summarizing the refined proposal.
    *   **Tool:** `new_task`
    *   **Inputs Provided by Coordinator:**
        *   Path to the proposal directory: `proposal_base_path`.
        *   Path to the `Refinement_Notes.md` file.
        *   Path to the initial input files (`input_path`) for context.
        *   Proposal Name (`[ProposalName]`).
    *   **Instructions for Delegate (`technical-writer`):**
        *   "Read the `Refinement_Notes.md` and initial input files located within `[proposal_base_path]`."
        *   "Generate a comprehensive whitepaper document summarizing the refined proposal. Structure it logically (e.g., Introduction, Problem Statement, Proposed Solution, Scope, Key Features, Potential Benefits, Conclusion)."
        *   "Save the whitepaper as `[proposal_base_path]/[ProposalName]_Whitepaper.md` using `write_to_file`." *Confirmation required before write.*
        *   "Ensure the content adheres to standard documentation practices and uses TOML+MD format if appropriate (though likely just Markdown body needed here unless a specific template is required)."
        *   "Report completion, providing the path to the whitepaper file."
    *   **Expected Output from Delegate:** Confirmation of completion, path to `[ProposalName]_Whitepaper.md`.
    *   **Coordinator Action (Post-Delegation):** Await confirmation. Verify the whitepaper file exists. Log completion. Proceed to Step 4.
    *   **Error Handling:** If the delegate fails, log the error, potentially retry or assign to a different writer/mode.

*   **Step 4: Implementation Document Generation (Coordinator delegates to `project-manager` or `core-architect`)**
    *   **Description:** Generate documents related to the practical implementation of the proposal.
    *   **Tool:** `new_task`
    *   **Inputs Provided by Coordinator:**
        *   Path to the proposal directory: `proposal_base_path`.
        *   Path to the `Refinement_Notes.md` file.
        *   Path to the `[ProposalName]_Whitepaper.md` file.
    *   **Instructions for Delegate (`project-manager` / `core-architect`):**
        *   "Review the refined proposal details in `Refinement_Notes.md` and `[ProposalName]_Whitepaper.md` located at `[proposal_base_path]`."
        *   "Generate relevant implementation documents. Examples include:"
            *   `Implementation_Plan.md`: High-level steps, potential phases, resource considerations.
            *   `Concerns_Analysis.md`: Potential risks, challenges, open questions, mitigation ideas.
            *   `Improvements_Suggestions.md`: Ideas for future enhancements beyond the core proposal.
        *   "Create these documents as separate Markdown files within the `[proposal_base_path]` directory using `write_to_file`." *Confirmation required before each write.*
        *   "Focus on actionable insights relevant to planning and execution."
        *   "Report completion, providing the paths to all created implementation documents."
    *   **Expected Output from Delegate:** Confirmation of completion, list of paths to created implementation documents.
    *   **Coordinator Action (Post-Delegation):** Await confirmation. Verify the implementation documents exist. Log completion. Proceed to Step 5.
    *   **Error Handling:** If the delegate fails, log the error, potentially retry or assign to a different mode.

*   **Step 5: Completion (Coordinator Task)**
    *   **Description:** Verify all artifacts have been created and finalize the workflow.
    *   **Inputs:** Confirmation and file paths from previous steps.
    *   **Procedure:**
        1.  Verify the existence of:
            *   `.ruru/planning/[ProposalName]/input/` (with initial files)
            *   `.ruru/planning/[ProposalName]/Refinement_Notes.md`
            *   `.ruru/planning/[ProposalName]/[ProposalName]_Whitepaper.md`
            *   `.ruru/planning/[ProposalName]/Implementation_Plan.md` (and others created in Step 4)
        2.  Log the successful completion of the planning proposal workflow, referencing the `proposal_base_path`.
        3.  Inform the user that the planning proposal process is complete and provide the path to the main proposal directory.
    *   **Outputs:** Final confirmation to the user, logged completion status.
    *   **Error Handling:** If verification fails, attempt to re-run the relevant failed step or report the inconsistency.

## 7. Postconditions ‚úÖ
*   The directory `.ruru/planning/[ProposalName]/` exists.
*   The `input/` subdirectory contains the initial user-provided materials.
*   `Refinement_Notes.md` exists, capturing the interactive refinement process.
*   `[ProposalName]_Whitepaper.md` exists, providing a formal summary.
*   Implementation-related documents (e.g., `Implementation_Plan.md`, `Concerns_Analysis.md`) exist.
*   The workflow completion is logged.

## 8. Error Handling & Escalation (Overall) ‚ö†Ô∏è
*   Individual steps include specific error handling.
*   If a delegated task fails repeatedly, the `prime-coordinator` should log the failure, potentially try an alternative delegate if appropriate, or escalate to the user for clarification or manual intervention.
*   Persistent file system errors should be reported clearly.
*   Reference the Adaptive Failure Resolution process (`.ruru/processes/afr-process.md`) if applicable.
