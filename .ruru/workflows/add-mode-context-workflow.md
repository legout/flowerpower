# Workflow: Add Context File to Mode KB

## 1. Objective üéØ
*   To add a new context file (e.g., rule, guideline, best practice) to a specified mode's Knowledge Base (KB) directory (`.ruru/modes/<slug>/kb/`) and update the corresponding KB README file.

## 2. Scope ‚ÜîÔ∏è
*   Applies when adding new, distinct pieces of context information as separate files within an existing mode's `.ruru/modes/<slug>/kb/` directory. Does not cover major refactoring of existing KB files.

## 3. Roles & Responsibilities üë§
*   **Coordinator (Roo Commander):** Gathers requirements (target mode, content, filename), delegates file creation and README update, verifies completion.
*   **Worker Agent (e.g., `util-writer`, `util-mode-maintainer`):** Creates the new context file and updates the KB README based on Coordinator's instructions.

## 4. Preconditionsüö¶
*   The target mode's directory structure (`.ruru/modes/<slug>/kb/`) exists.
*   The target mode's KB README (`.ruru/modes/<slug>/kb/README.md`) exists.
*   The Coordinator has the content for the new context file (either provided by the user or generated).
*   The Coordinator has determined a suitable filename for the new context file (e.g., `NN-topic-summary.md`).

## 5. Reference Documents & Tools üìöüõ†Ô∏è
*   `.ruru/modes/<slug>/kb/`: Target directory.
*   `.ruru/modes/<slug>/kb/README.md`: Target README file.
*   `.ruru/templates/toml-md/08_ai_context_source.md`: Recommended template for the new context file.
*   `write_to_file`: Tool to create the new context file.
*   `apply_diff` / `search_and_replace`: Tools to update the KB README.
*   `read_file`: Tool for Coordinator to verify changes (optional).

## 6. Workflow Steps ü™ú

*   **Step 1: Gather Requirements (Coordinator Task)**
    *   **Description:** Identify the target mode, the content for the new context file, and a suitable filename.
    *   **Inputs:** User request specifying the mode and the context to add.
    *   **Procedure:**
        *   Confirm the target mode slug (e.g., `roo-commander`).
        *   Determine the full path to the KB directory (e.g., `.ruru/modes/roo-commander/kb/`).
        *   Determine an appropriate filename (e.g., `10-adding-context-files-rule.md`). Ensure numbering follows existing KB convention if applicable.
        *   Obtain or formulate the content for the new file. Recommend using the `.ruru/templates/toml-md/08_ai_context_source.md` structure for the content.
    *   **Outputs:** Target mode slug, KB directory path, new filename, file content.

*   **Step 2: Delegate Context File Creation (Coordinator delegates to Worker Agent)**
    *   **Description:** Create the new context file in the target mode's KB directory.
    *   **Tool:** `new_task` (delegating to e.g., `util-writer`)
    *   **Inputs Provided by Coordinator:**
        *   Full path for the new file (e.g., `.ruru/modes/roo-commander/kb/10-adding-context-files-rule.md`).
        *   Complete content for the new file.
    *   **Instructions for Delegate:** "Using `write_to_file`, create a new file at the specified path with the provided content."
    *   **Expected Output from Delegate:** Confirmation of successful file creation.
    *   **Coordinator Action (Post-Delegation):** Wait for confirmation.
    *   **Error Handling:** If the delegate fails, analyze the error. Check path validity, content format, and permissions. Retry or report to user.

*   **Step 3: Delegate KB README Update (Coordinator delegates to Worker Agent)**
    *   **Description:** Add an entry for the new context file to the target mode's KB README.
    *   **Tool:** `new_task` (delegating to e.g., `util-writer`)
    *   **Inputs Provided by Coordinator:**
        *   Path to the KB README (e.g., `.ruru/modes/roo-commander/kb/README.md`).
        *   Filename of the newly created context file (e.g., `10-adding-context-files-rule.md`).
        *   A brief description of the new file's content.
    *   **Instructions for Delegate:** "Using `apply_diff` or `search_and_replace`, update the specified KB README file. Add a new bullet point to the list of KB files, including the new filename and the provided description. Ensure the list remains properly formatted." (Consider instructing to insert before a specific line, like a 'Miscellaneous' section or just before the end marker, if applicable).
    *   **Expected Output from Delegate:** Confirmation of successful README update.
    *   **Coordinator Action (Post-Delegation):** Wait for confirmation.
    *   **Error Handling:** If the delegate fails, analyze the error. Use `read_file` on the README to understand the current state. Retry the update with more specific instructions (e.g., using `apply_diff` with exact line numbers) or report to user.

*   **Step 4: Final Report (Coordinator Task)**
    *   **Description:** Inform the user that the context file has been added and the KB README updated.
    *   **Procedure:** Use `attempt_completion`.

## 7. Postconditions ‚úÖ
*   The new context file exists in the specified mode's KB directory.
*   The mode's KB README includes an entry for the new file.

## 8. Error Handling & Escalation (Overall) ‚ö†Ô∏è
*   If file writing or README updates fail repeatedly, check file system permissions or potential file corruption.
*   Escalate to the user if the target mode or its KB structure doesn't exist as expected.

## 9. PAL Validation Record üß™
*   Date Validated: 2025-04-19
*   Method: Conceptual Review.
*   Test Case(s): N/A (Simple workflow).
*   Findings/Refinements: Seems straightforward. Emphasized using appropriate tools for README update.

## 10. Revision History üìú
*   v1.0 (2025-04-19): Initial draft.
