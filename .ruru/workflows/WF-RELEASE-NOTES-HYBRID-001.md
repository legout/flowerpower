# Workflow: Generate Release Notes (Hybrid Approach)

This workflow generates release notes by analyzing Git history between two tags, creates a local Markdown file, and optionally attempts to push the notes to a GitHub Release using the GitHub MCP server. It follows the Hybrid approach (Option C) and the recommended Hybrid Source of Truth.

## Checklist

-   [ ] **1. Initialization & Input Validation:**
    -   [ ] üì£ Verify required parameters (`target_tag`).
    *   [ ] Determine `previous_tag`: If not provided, delegate to `dev-git` or GitHub MCP (`get_latest_tag`?) to find the latest tag before `target_tag`. Store result.
    *   [ ] ‚ùó If `push_to_github` is true, verify `github_owner` and `github_repo` are provided. Fail if not.
    *   [ ] ‚ùó Verify the existence and connectivity of the GitHub MCP server if `push_to_github` is true. Fail if not available.

-   [ ] **2. Query Git History:**
    *   [ ] Delegate to `dev-git`: Execute `git log --pretty=format:"%H ||| %s ||| %b%n---COMMIT-END---%n" <previous_tag>..<target_tag>`. Use clear delimiters like `|||` and `---COMMIT-END---` for easier parsing.
    *   [ ] ‚ùó Store the raw `git log` output. Handle potential errors from `dev-git` (e.g., invalid tags).

-   [ ] **3. Parse & Filter Commits:**
    *   [ ] Process the raw `git log` output line by line or commit by commit.
    *   [ ] For each commit:
        *   [ ] Parse hash, subject, and body using the delimiters.
        *   [ ] Identify Conventional Commit type (`feat`, `fix`, `perf`, `refactor`, `chore`, `docs`, `test`, etc.) from the subject. Skip commits without a recognized type or merge commits (unless configured otherwise).
        *   [ ] Extract scope (if present).
        *   [ ] Extract `Refs: TASK-...` from the footer. Store Task ID(s).
    *   [ ] Store the filtered and parsed commit data, grouped by type (e.g., `features: [{subject, hash, taskId}, ...]`, `fixes: [...]`).

-   [ ] **4. Summarize Changes (Hybrid Source of Truth):**
    *   [ ] Initialize Markdown sections for each commit type (Features, Bug Fixes, etc.).
    *   [ ] For each parsed commit in each group:
        *   [ ] ‚ùì **(Enhancement):** If a `taskId` exists:
            *   [ ] Delegate to `agent-context-resolver` or `prime-txt` to read the corresponding MDTM task file (`.ruru/tasks/.../TASK-....md`).
            *   [ ] Extract the task `title` from the TOML frontmatter. Use this title if available.
            *   [ ] *Alternative/Simpler:* Just use the commit subject line.
        *   [ ] Format the entry (e.g., `- Scope: Title/Subject (Commit Hash, Refs: TASK-ID)` or similar). Add to the appropriate Markdown section string.
    *   [ ] Combine the formatted sections into a single `release_notes_body` Markdown string.

-   [ ] **5. Generate Local Release Notes File:**
    *   [ ] Define output filename: `{{output_dir}}/{{target_tag}}.md`.
    *   [ ] Prepare TOML frontmatter for the local file using a template (e.g., `NN_release_notes.md`), including version, date, related tags, etc.
    *   [ ] Combine TOML and the `release_notes_body`.
    *   [ ] Delegate to `prime-txt`: Use `write_to_file` to create the local file at the defined path with the combined content.
    *   [ ] ‚ùó Handle potential file writing errors.
    *   [ ] üì£ Report success and the path to the created local file.

-   [ ] **6. ‚ùì Optional: Push to GitHub Release (via MCP):**
    *   [ ] **IF `push_to_github` is true:**
        *   [ ] üì£ Indicate attempt to push to GitHub.
        *   [ ] Delegate to GitHub MCP server (`create_release` or `update_release` - need logic to check if release/tag already exists):
            *   Provide `owner`, `repo`, `target_tag`.
            *   Provide `release_notes_body` as the body.
            *   Set release `name` (e.g., "Version {{target_tag}}").
            *   Set `draft = {{mark_as_draft}}`, `prerelease = {{mark_as_prerelease}}`.
        *   [ ] ‚ùó Handle potential errors from the MCP server (authentication, API errors, tag already exists, etc.).
        *   [ ] üì£ Report success (with link to draft release) or failure of the GitHub push attempt.
    *   [ ] **ELSE:**
        *   [ ] üì£ Skip GitHub push as requested.

-   [ ] **7. Final Report:**
    *   [ ] üì£ Report overall completion, summarizing which steps were successful (local file creation, optional GitHub push).
