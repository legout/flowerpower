# Create Multiple Specialized Roo Commander Builds (Batch)

## 1. Objective üéØ
*   Automate the generation of multiple, predefined Roo Commander builds, each containing a specific subset of modes defined in `.ruru/config/build_collections.json`.

## 2. Scope ‚ÜîÔ∏è
*   This workflow reads collection definitions from `.ruru/config/build_collections.json`, iterates through them, generates the necessary `.roomodes` file for each collection, executes the `create_build.js` script (passing collection-specific arguments if needed), and reports the overall status.

## 3. Roles & Responsibilities üë§
*   **Roo Commander:** Orchestrates the entire batch process, reads configuration, manages the loop, generates `.roomodes` files, executes the build script via `execute_command` for each collection, monitors results, and reports the final outcome.
*   **Build Script (`create_build.js`):** Performs the actual filtering and packaging for a single build based on the `.roomodes` file and potentially other arguments (like output directory/name).

## 4. Preconditionsüö¶
*   The configuration file `.ruru/config/build_collections.json` exists and contains valid JSON defining the collections.
*   The build script `create_build.js` exists, is functional, and can handle being run multiple times (potentially with arguments to differentiate outputs).
*   The full set of modes is available for filtering.

## 5. Reference Documents & Tools üìöüõ†Ô∏è
*   Config: `.ruru/config/build_collections.json`
*   Scripts: `create_build.js`
*   Tools: `read_file`, `write_to_file`, `execute_command`, `ask_followup_question` (for error handling).

## 6. Workflow Steps ü™ú

*   **Step 1: Read Build Collections Config (Roo Commander Task)**
    *   **Description:** Load the predefined mode collections.
    *   **Inputs:** File path `.ruru/config/build_collections.json`.
    *   **Procedure:** Use `read_file` to get the content of the JSON configuration. Parse the JSON content.
    *   **Outputs:** Parsed object containing the collection definitions.
    *   **Error Handling:** If `read_file` fails or JSON parsing fails, report error to the user and terminate the workflow.

*   **Step 2: Resolve Core Modes (Roo Commander Task - Optional Optimization)**
    *   **Description:** If collections reference "core", resolve the list of core modes once.
    *   **Inputs:** Parsed collection data from Step 1.
    *   **Procedure:** Check if a "core" collection exists. If yes, store its list of modes.
    *   **Outputs:** List of core mode slugs (if applicable).

*   **Step 3: Iterate Through Collections (Roo Commander Loop)**
    *   **Description:** Loop through each collection name defined in the parsed configuration (e.g., "core", "fullstack_react_supabase", "full").
    *   **For each collection:** Perform Steps 4-6.

*   **Step 4: Prepare Mode List for Collection (Roo Commander Task)**
    *   **Description:** Determine the final list of mode slugs for the current collection.
    *   **Inputs:** Current collection name, parsed collection data, resolved core modes list (from Step 2).
    *   **Procedure:**
        *   Get the list associated with the current collection name.
        *   If the list contains "core", replace "core" with the actual list of core mode slugs resolved in Step 2.
        *   Handle the special "full" collection: If the collection name is "full" and its value is `["all"]`, note this special case for Step 5/6 (the build script might handle "all" directly, or it might require generating a `.roomodes` with all known modes, or skipping `.roomodes` generation). Clarify script behavior if needed.
    *   **Outputs:** Final list of mode slugs for the current collection (or indication of "full" build).

*   **Step 5: Generate `.roomodes` File for Collection (Roo Commander Task)**
    *   **Description:** Create the `.roomodes` file specific to the current collection.
    *   **Inputs:** Final mode list for the collection (from Step 4).
    *   **Procedure:**
        *   **Unless** it's the special "full" collection handled differently by the script:
            *   Format the list of slugs into a newline-separated string.
            *   Use `write_to_file` to create/overwrite the `.roomodes` file in the workspace root.
    *   **Outputs:** `.roomodes` file updated for the current collection (or skipped).
    *   **Error Handling:** If `write_to_file` fails, log the error for this collection, report it, and potentially ask the user whether to continue with other collections.

*   **Step 6: Execute Build Script for Collection (Roo Commander delegates to `execute_command`)**
    *   **Description:** Run the `create_build.js` script for the current collection.
    *   **Tool:** `execute_command`
    *   **Inputs Provided by Coordinator:** Command to run the script. **Crucially, the script might need arguments** to specify the collection name and/or a unique output directory/filename for this collection's build artifact (e.g., `node create_build.js --collection core --output ./builds/core`). This needs clarification based on `create_build.js` capabilities.
    *   **Instructions for Delegate (`execute_command`):**
        *   Command: `node create_build.js [ARGUMENTS]` (e.g., `node create_build.js --collection <collection_name> --output ./builds/<collection_name>`).
        *   Explain: "This command executes the build script for the '<collection_name>' collection, creating a filtered build artifact."
    *   **Expected Output from Delegate:** Terminal output indicating success or failure. Exit code 0 for success.
    *   **Coordinator Action (Post-Delegation):**
        *   Wait for command completion.
        *   Record the success/failure status for this collection based on exit code and output. Log key output messages.
    *   **Error Handling:** If the command fails, log the error details for this collection. Decide whether to stop the batch or continue with the next collection (potentially ask the user).

*   **Step 7: Report Batch Outcome (Roo Commander Task)**
    *   **Description:** Inform the user about the overall result of the batch build process.
    *   **Inputs:** Success/failure status recorded for each collection in Step 6.
    *   **Procedure:** Summarize which collections were built successfully and which failed, providing error details for failures.
    *   **Outputs:** User notification via `<attempt_completion>`.

## 7. Postconditions ‚úÖ
*   Build artifacts exist for all successfully processed collections (likely in distinct output locations).
*   A summary report of the batch build success/failure is provided to the user.

## 8. Error Handling & Escalation (Overall) ‚ö†Ô∏è
*   Failure to read/parse config is fatal for the batch.
*   Failure to write `.roomodes` for a collection should be logged, and the user potentially consulted about continuing.
*   Failure of the build script for one collection should be logged, and the user potentially consulted about continuing the batch run for other collections.
